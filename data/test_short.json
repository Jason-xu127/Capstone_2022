          "Keith Jackson, the folksy voice of college football who for decades wove backwoods wit throughout his Saturday afternoon broadcasts on ABC, died Jan. 12. He was 89. ESPN first announced his death. Other details were not immediately available. In a 54-year broadcasting career, Mr. Jackson covered a wide variety of sports for radio and television, but he was best known as ABC's voice of NCAA football - and for the homespun phrases he used. To Mr. Jackson, linemen were not guards and tackles, they were \"the big uglies.\" Running backs did not drop the ball; there was a \"fuumm-bull!\" Of an undersized player, he might say, \"He's a little-bitty thing, a bantam rooster. But he's young. If he keeps eatin' his cornbread, he'll be man-sized someday.\" And, of course, there was \"Whoa, Nellie!\" - his signature phrase. Mr. Jackson in 2014. (Dean Hare/AP) Or was it? Strangers in restaurants, airports, stadium parking lots and downtown streets would sidle up to Mr. Jackson and bellow, \"Whoa, Nellie!\"",
          "Keith Jackson, homespun voice of college football, dies at 89",
          "After announcing his retirement in 1998, he was honored wherever he went to work games. At the University of Michigan, the marching band spelled out, \"THANKS KEITH.\" On the air, Mr. Jackson kept his opinions to himself, concentrating on the action. His broadcasting philosophy was a simple one: \"Amplify, clarify and punctuate, and let the viewer draw his or her own conclusion.\" He was roundly criticized for ignoring an ugly incident late in the 1978 Gator Bowl game, when Ohio State coach Woody Hayes punched Clemson player Charlie Baumann after Baumann had intercepted a pass near the Ohio State sideline. Recalling the scene for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1999, Mr. Jackson said that because the sideline was crowded with players and officials, \"the fact of the matter is, I didn't see [the punch]. . . . If people go back and listen, I said, 'Let's look at the tape and see what happened.' \" Mr. Jackson rose above that incident, later winning an Emmy and being inducted into two sportscasting halls of fame. Besides his college football work, he called college and pro basketball games, Major League Baseball, auto racing and the Summer and Winter Olympics. In 1970, he was the first play-by-play announcer for the \"Monday Night Football\" NFL broadcast on ABC. Survivors include his wife, three children and three grandchildren."

          "Keith Max Jackson was born Oct. 18, 1928, near Carrollton, Ga. He practiced broadcasting as a youngster growing up on a farm. \"My grandma once told my mama,\" he recalled, \" 'the kid's walking crazy around the cornfield, talking to himself.' I was calling ballgames.\" Mr. Jackson served a four-year stint in the Marine Corps and was attending Washington State University on the GI Bill, studying criminology and political science, when he listened to a student broadcast of a football game. He reportedly thought he could do better, said as much to the professor in charge of the broadcasting program, and was handed a tape recorder and told to go cover something. He chose a high school basketball game. \"They turned the lights out at halftime,\" he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in 1999. \"I didn't have the foggiest idea what to do, so I just told stories.\" By 1952, Mr. Jackson was calling Washington State games on the school station. After graduating in 1954, he went to work at KOMO-TV in Seattle. His proudest achievement there was accompanying the University of Washington rowing crew to the Soviet Union, where he became the first American to call a live sports event in the country despite serious hassles over equipment, censorship and accessibility to the site. Mr. Jackson joined the ABC radio network in 1965, freelancing TV assignments before settling in permanently at ABC when Roone Arledge needed someone to call a parachute-jumping segment for \"Wide World of Sports\" in 1968. ABC quickly put him on college football, and the fit was nearly perfect.",

He also said he regrets not doing more to call attention to the problem during his coaching days. \"I feel disappointed in myself, because I knew this stuff was going on for a long time, and I never really was vocal enough,\" Williams said on this week's Basketball Coaches DC Podcast. \"I got criticized a lot in terms of recruiting because [I] didn't get a certain player, but I should've been more forceful in my response to that, because coaches know when certain coaches are doing things they shouldn't be doing.\" The episode was recorded in the wake of reports that current and former players at more than 20 Division I schools received impermissible benefits, and that Arizona Coach Sean Miller discussed a $100,000 bribe to land star recruit Deandre Ayton. Williams has discussed cheating in college basketball before. In 2009, after a three-part series in The Washington Post examined Maryland's recruiting struggles, including Williams's refusal to deal with influential power brokers on the AAU scene responsible for steering players to certain schools, Williams told a local radio station there was more cheating going on in the sport than he had seen in his 31 years as a head coach. \"I'm a little concerned,\" Williams said then about the state of college basketball. \"I don't want to sound like the old head, like things aren't the way they used to be, but something has got to be done.",

After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.

          "Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form."

          "CHARLOTTESVILLE &mdash; Charles Snowden gripped the sledgehammer tightly, raised it over his head and swung straight down with all his might, demolishing into pebbles and dust a chunk of stone placed on the floor of the Virginia football team&rsquo;s locker room.&ldquo;Breaking the rock&rdquo; has become a raucous part of the Cavaliers&rsquo; victory celebrations this season, including following a 27-3 romp over Louisville in the ACC opener Saturday during which Snowden filled the defensive stat sheet in virtually every category.The performance earned the linebacker was the third player, and first non-senior, to take part in the tradition that Shawn Griswold, the team&rsquo;s first-year director of football development and performance, introduced at the start of the season.Given how briskly Snowden has ascended into a difference-maker despite a limited football background, Coach Bronco Mendenhall indicated he expects the sophomore from Silver Spring, Md., who played less than two full seasons at the varsity level in high school at St. Albans in the District, to be a frequent boulder buster. His next chance will be Saturday afternoon when Virginia (3-1, 1-0) plays at N.C. State (3-0, 0-0).&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the limit is with him,&rdquo; Mendenhall said of Snowden, who stands 6 feet 7 and weights 225 pounds. &ldquo;The size, the range, the speed but also the type of person, those type of people, they maximize their abilities. It&rsquo;ll be fun to watch.&rdquo;Starting for just the fourth time in college this past weekend, Snowden collected eight total tackles, including one and a half for loss, two pass breakups, one sack, one interception and one fumble recovery against the Cardinals.The Cavaliers held an ACC opponent without a touchdown for the first time since 2009 and limited the Cardinals to 66 rushing yards. They also forced three turnovers, including Snowden&rsquo;s interception on the second play of the second quarter, leading to Virginia taking the lead for good on its ensuing possession.&ldquo;We had gone over their route combinations all week, so I had a good idea of what they were going to do,&rdquo; said Snowden, who on Monday was named ACC linebacker of the week.",

          "&ldquo;The quarterback threw the ball, I got a good break, and since I&rsquo;ve been blessed with long arms, I could go out there and grab it.&rdquo;Those long arms, naturally, served Snowden well in basketball, which he played in addition to junior varsity football at Blake, a public high school at Silver Spring. It was St. Albans assistant varsity basketball coach Bobby Fields who initially encouraged Snowden&rsquo;s father, Charles Sr., to consider the all-boys private school in Northwest D.C. when the two sat next to one another at a basketball game between Blake and Springbrook. The younger Snowden transferred to St. Albans in 2014 and, despite some reservations, reclassified as a sophomore.&ldquo;In the spirit of the bigger picture, he did not fight it,&rdquo; Snowden&rsquo;s father said. &ldquo;That extra year, it was humongous. It allowed him to grow physically.",

Johnson, coincidentally a former two-year football player at Virginia, but sitting in the stands with his family watching a varsity football game at the start of his junior year sparked Snowden&rsquo;s urge to play that sport again, particularly since the school had unveiled newly renovated athletic fields.Bulldogs football Coach Gary Schnell gladly inserted Snowden as a hybrid stand-up defensive end-outside linebacker four games into the season. Playing in only seven games that year, Snowden became an all-conference selection. By his senior year, Snowden also was playing wide receiver.",

A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated."

It is often called house cat when kept as indoor pet or feral/feral domestic cat when wild. It is often valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt vermin. There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries."

The Redskins need him to be a versatile, change-of-pace back, part of an expected 1-2 punch with rookie Derrius Guice, for the offense to reach its potential in 2018. \"When you're talking about your best players Chris and Jordan [Reed] and Trent [Williams] and Morgan [Moses] and some of these guys,\" Coach Jay Gruden said before practice, \"they got to get out there and practice, but it's sometimes you just want to treat them like a china doll. You're like, 'Oh, please don't get hit.' But eventually they're going to have to put the pads on and practice. \"And Chris is getting to a point right now, we're going to put him in some team periods today, watch the reps he has and the defense will take good care of him because they know what kind of value he has to this football team. But, he's coming along great and I anticipate him being full go sooner than later.\" More on the Redskins: Jamison Crowder-Alex Smith connection is starting to flourish Redskins rookie Tim Settle taking advantage of extra opportunities First-round pick Daron Payne out 2-3 weeks with ankle injury Vernon Davis confident in this year's offense: 'This is one of the best teams I've ever been on'",

(John McDonnell/The Washington Post) St. John's rising senior running back Keilan Robinson announced his verbal commitment to Alabama Wednesday night via Twitter. Robinson had already been committed to the Crimson Tide for about a week, but decided to hold off on making his announcement public. Robinson, a four-star prospect, is the No. 1 running back in the D.C-area and the No. 18 running back nationally, according to the 247 Composite ratings. The 5-foot-9, 184-pound athlete had 24 offers from high-major colleges and narrowed it down to Alabama, Penn State, Florida State, Maryland, Michigan and Southern Cal before choosing the Crimson Tide. He picked up an offer from Alabama on Feb. 27 and took an unofficial visit to Tuscaloosa on April 7 before attending camp at Alabama on June 2. \"I feel like I can go there and make an impact right now,\" Robinson said. \"Their offense, they don't have a guy like me who can return kicks, catch balls, line up in slot and in the backfield ... I am like a Swiss army knife for them.\" I'm committed.... @BAnyMeansMedia @colemanayers31  - Keilan Robinson (@krobb__) June 27, 2018 Robinson said he had a dream three weeks ago that he was a student athlete at Alabama suiting up for a game and that is one of the reasons why he decided on the Crimson Tide.",

          "The Washington Redskins traded a 2019 fourth-round draft pick for Green Bay Packers safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, the team announced Tuesday afternoon. The move strengthens a defense that is already one of the NFL&rsquo;s best, and it reflects the team&rsquo;s willingness to give up a future asset to improve its playoff chances this season.The Redskins, who lead the NFC East with a 5-2 record, added to its secondary ahead of the league&rsquo;s 4 p.m. trade deadline Tuesday. Clinton-Dix gives the Redskins one of the best safety tandems in the league with Clinton-Dix and D.J. Swearinger, who leads the NFL with four interceptions.Clinton-Dix is in the final year of his rookie contract, after the Packers picked up his fifth-year option for the 2018 season. He was the No. 21 overall pick in 2014 out of Alabama, and he made the Pro Bowl in 2016 when he had five interceptions and 79 tackles. He had 100-plus tackles in his first two seasons and has not missed a single game during his five-year career. Clinton-Dix has recorded 27 tackles, three interceptions, one sack and one forced fumble in 2018.He is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent in 2019 and became a trade candidate after he and the Packers weren&rsquo;t able to agree to a long-term deal.&ldquo;Right now, I&rsquo;m playing each and every game like it&rsquo;s my last. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to be here next year,&rdquo; Clinton-Dix told the Wisconsin State Journal earlier this month.",

          "The Washington Redskins traded a 2019 fourth-round draft pick for Green Bay Packers safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, the team announced Tuesday afternoon. The move strengthens a defense that is already one of the NFL&rsquo;s best, and it reflects the team&rsquo;s willingness to give up a future asset to improve its playoff chances this season.The Redskins, who lead the NFC East with a 5-2 record, added to its secondary ahead of the league&rsquo;s 4 p.m. trade deadline Tuesday. Clinton-Dix gives the Redskins one of the best safety tandems in the league with Clinton-Dix and D.J. Swearinger, who leads the NFL with four interceptions.Clinton-Dix is in the final year of his rookie contract, after the Packers picked up his fifth-year option for the 2018 season. He was the No. 21 overall pick in 2014 out of Alabama, and he made the Pro Bowl in 2016 when he had five interceptions and 79 tackles. He had 100-plus tackles in his first two seasons and has not missed a single game during his five-year career. Clinton-Dix has recorded 27 tackles, three interceptions, one sack and one forced fumble in 2018.He is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent in 2019 and became a trade candidate after he and the Packers weren&rsquo;t able to agree to a long-term deal.&ldquo;Right now, I&rsquo;m playing each and every game like it&rsquo;s my last. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to be here next year,&rdquo; Clinton-Dix told the Wisconsin State Journal earlier this month.",

          "Redskins running backs Adrian Peterson and Kapri Bibbs go through a drill together. (Nick Wass/Associated Press) There was no stopping Kapri Bibbs now. The Washington Redskins reserve running back was standing in front of his locker at the team's practice facility Wednesday afternoon, talking about the man he considers the greatest back of his generation. \"He's a great dude,\" Bibbs said about Adrian Peterson, his voice rising above the din of conversation around him. \"He works hard, man, he works hard as [expletive]! And it's great to pick the brain of a man who had the success he's had in this league.\" Bibbs pointed to the nameplate above Peterson's locker, which by the luck of an equipment man's assignment wound up beside his. He beamed at the thought: The great Adrian Peterson dressing right next to him, Kapri Bibbs. Who would have imagined? \"This man is a role model,\" Bibbs continued. \"It was like AP with the elbow pads coming to play.\" [Adrian Peterson intends to start at running back for Redskins: 'Without a doubt'] Bibbs was going so fast he didn't notice Peterson had walked into the locker room, after his second day of practice as a Washington Redskin, dressed only in football pants. Peterson sat down and quietly listened to an impromptu testimonial from his new teammate, who was practically lunging into his locker space. \"The Packers were my team growing up,\" Bibbs said, waving his arms.",

Sports commonly called football in certain places include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. These different variations of football are known as football codes."

          "Jackie (Laurie Metcalf), center, and Roseanne (Roseanne Barr) spar over differing politics in the \"Roseanne\" reboot, which premiered Tuesday. (Adam Rose/ABC) Roseanne Barr's politics have historically been tough to pinpoint. The actress claimed in a since-deleted tweet from December that journalists used to call her a liberal \"back in the day,\" probably during the original \"Roseanne\" run. (She often exhibited socially liberal qualities in real life and on screen.) Then, in 2012, Barr sought the Green Party nomination for the presidency. She has recently opted to circulate conspiracy theories of the pro-Trump Internet. Given this last development, ABC's revival of the '90s sitcom was destined to get people talking. An audience of 18.4 million watched the one-hour premiere Tuesday night, which led to a deluge of tweets and think pieces and a congratulatory call to Barr from the president himself. Those reactions, like Barr's politics, have been all over the place. Biting criticism appears online between supportive messages, neither of which necessarily corresponds with political views.

          "For the past six years, the Redskins went through a gamut of tumult and drama &mdash; much of it self-inflicted &mdash; while attempting to develop two quarterbacks from one draft class. First there was Robert Griffin III, an instant success who was incinerated by the flames of his own rising star and ultimately undone by injuries that were exacerbated by Washington&rsquo;s institutional dysfunction. Then there was Kirk Cousins, the unlikely successor whose willingness to bet on himself grew into a lucrative exit strategy.By acquiring Alex Smith from Kansas City this offseason, the Redskins have introduced a leader into their locker room who, compared to his predecessors, must seem like a steady, stoic stepdad ready to put an end to the family&rsquo;s feuding ways.Cast out by Kansas City after completing the finest season of his 13-year career, Smith offers Washington something the city hasn&rsquo;t truly had since the Redskins last hoisted the Lombardi Trophy on Jan. 26, 1992: A fully formed franchise quarterback who&rsquo;s committed for the long haul.While Cousins&rsquo; critics say he wasn&rsquo;t being authentic when he insisted he wanted to stay in Washington, Smith told reporters at his introductory news conference in March, &ldquo;This is where I wanted to be.&rdquo;In their own ways, Griffin and Cousins were big talkers. Griffin, who&rsquo;s now a backup quarterback in Baltimore, talked up his catchphrases and brand &mdash; and he had a habit of blaming his teammates&rsquo; shortcomings. Cousins, who&rsquo;s now tasked with guiding a Super Bowl contender in Minnesota, talked about seeing the world in 15-minute increments, hunkering down in a film-watching nook and how, gee, he&rsquo;d really love to stick around if the Redskins would just break the bank instead of asking him to play under the franchise tag for two straight seasons.Since Smith&rsquo;s arrival in a deal that sent promising cornerback Kendall Fuller and a third-round pick to the Chiefs, Washington&rsquo;s new quarterback has won the respect of the locker room with what he&rsquo;s left unsaid.&ldquo;He just came in, and he was quiet,&rdquo; running back Chris Thompson said. &ldquo;He just let everything work itself out.

          "Once Jim Harbaugh became coach in San Francisco, Smith led the 49ers to a 13-3 record and their first playoff win in nine years.A concussion Smith suffered the following season opened the door for Colin Kaepernick to elbow Smith out of the job, and Smith was traded to the Chiefs in 2013 for two second-round picks.In five seasons with Kansas City, Smith was one of 12 NFL quarterbacks to start at least 76 games. He threw the fewest interceptions (33) of anyone on that list. He also threw the second-fewest touchdown passes (102) &mdash; only Joe Flacco tossed fewer. As the Chiefs&rsquo; starter, Smith won 50 regular-season games, made three Pro Bowls and led Kansas City to the postseason four times. Last season, he led the NFL in passer rating with a mark of 104.7.But his 1-4 playoff record with the Chiefs left the team unsatisfied, and for the second time in his career, he was traded away.No one would be able to survive so many years in the pressure cooker that is life in the league without developing a thick skin.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like I have to prove myself to anybody any longer,&rdquo; Smith told The Washington Post this summer.So when it came time for Smith to make a first impression on the Redskins&rsquo; locker room, he didn&rsquo;t need to campaign for himself. All he needed to do was go about his business as usual.Safety D.J. Swearinger noticed how Smith&rsquo;s command of the huddle settled the offense, how Smith was looking off safeties and making smart decisions with the ball in practice.&ldquo;A lot of it isn&rsquo;t even him trying, it&rsquo;s just him being himself,&rdquo; Swearinger said."

(Adam Rose/ABC) Roseanne Barr's politics have historically been tough to pinpoint. The actress claimed in a since-deleted tweet from December that journalists used to call her a liberal \"back in the day,\" probably during the original \"Roseanne\" run. (She often exhibited socially liberal qualities in real life and on screen.) Then, in 2012, Barr sought the Green Party nomination for the presidency. She has recently opted to circulate conspiracy theories of the pro-Trump Internet. Given this last development, ABC's revival of the '90s sitcom was destined to get people talking. An audience of 18.4 million watched the one-hour premiere Tuesday night, which led to a deluge of tweets and think pieces and a congratulatory call to Barr from the president himself. Those reactions, like Barr's politics, have been all over the place. Biting criticism appears online between supportive messages, neither of which necessarily corresponds with political views.

          "The five kinds of reactions to the \u2018Roseanne\u2019 reboot, across the political spectrum",
          "1. Wholehearted approval of the sitcom and its star Barr is vocal about her support for the president, and so is her on-screen counterpart. In the show, Roseanne argues with her liberal sister, Jackie (Laurie Metcalf, sporting a \"Nasty Woman\" T-shirt), about their differing politics. She claims Trump \"talked about jobs, Jackie, he said to shake things up\" and tosses in a dig at \"Fake News.\" It makes sense that members of the Trump administration and family would approve of the reboot. Dan Scavino Jr., the White House's director of social media, congratulated the cast on his personal Twitter account. Donald Trump Jr. praised Barr and suggested she pursue a late-night TV show, too: \"Seems there's some demand for an alternate viewpoint.\" British journalist Piers Morgan took a firm stance, telling \"screaming Trump-hating liberals\" that the show's ratings meant \"not everyone in America thinks like you.\" 2. Cautious support for the depiction of familial struggles Variety TV critic Sonia Saraiya praised \"Roseanne\" for confronting \"the same harsh realities\" as the original show did more than two decades ago. The Conners have long been seen as one of the most accurate depictions of working-class America on television, and the series premiere continued the tradition, Saraiya said. Darlene (Sara Gilbert) has moved back in with her parents, Roseanne and Dan (John Goodman), after she loses her job.",
          "And those two struggle with the high costs of their prescription medication. Comedian Sarah Silverman tweeted that she \"loved\" the reboot because of how it portrayed the turmoil many families have experienced since Trump was elected president: \"That familiar feeling of the old but w comedy & content so totally of this moment like the angst w/in close families over politics. Hope y'all let go of needing art 2 reflect/express only what u yourself feel. That's not what art's 4.\" Roseanne Barr and John Goodman play spouses Roseanne and Dan Conner. (Adam Rose/ABC) 3. Criticism of how the show inaccurately represents Trump voters Jared Yates Sexton, a seemingly liberal Georgia Southern University professor, tweeted that the reboot presents an \"idealized version\" of the president's base. While the original show provided an honest, \"warts and all look\" at Middle America, he added, the current show glazes over the fact that Roseanne is turning \"a blind eye to Trump's many, many bigoted statements.\" Conservative radio host Ben Shapiro, on the other hand, said the show fails to represent Trump voters because it \"recasts Trump voters as social Leftists who just disagree about economics.\" Like Sexton, he used the word \"fantasy\" to describe the depiction and claimed that it presented the voters as \"people who agree with Hollywood elites on values, but just disagree on economics because they're old white factory workers.\" 4. Disapproval of how the sitcom treats politics Linda Holmes, host of NPR's \"Pop Culture Happy Hour,\" engaged with Saraiya in an online conversation about how the premiere treated politics itself."

Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)\u2014the earliest work of dramatic theory.The term \"drama\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"action\" (Classical Greek: \u03b4\u03c1\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1, drama), which is derived from \"I do\" (Classical Greek: \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9, drao). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. "

He&rsquo;s under contract with our team for a long time, and that is a great thing for the Patriots.&rdquo;Other possible Browns candidates include Oklahoma Coach Lincoln Riley, Vikings offensive coordinator John DeFilippo, and Packers Coach Mike McCarthy.The Browns, stocked with plenty of talent and a promising rookie quarterback in Baker Mayfield, will be an attractive destination, but there may be other openings as well. McCarthy, for instance, is doing himself no favors with his play-calling for Aaron Rodgers, who has passive aggressively questioned his head coach. There&rsquo;s a growing perception that Green Bay is wasting the prime of Rodgers, who turns 35 next month.The Tampa Bay Buccaneers reportedly are &ldquo;nearing a breaking point&rdquo; with Coach Dirk Koetter. Tampa Bay already fired its defensive coordinator and benched quarterback Jameis Winston, and might be running out of people to blame. Over the weekend, ESPN reported that the Ravens' John Harbaugh is on the hot seat; Sunday&rsquo;s loss to the Steelers can&rsquo;t have helped. Other teams that have to be considering their options include the Bills, Jaguars, Cowboys and maybe even the Jets and Broncos."

          "If Josh McDaniels isn't Bill Belichick's successor, he might find other NFL jobs scarce. (Elise Amendola/AP) With the New England Patriots mum as always, it was left to Indianapolis Colts General Manager Chris Ballard to explain just how the Colts were left holding the bag after Josh McDaniels decided this week to remain with the Patriots - roughly 24 hours before he was to be introduced as the Colts' next head coach. Ballard's closing words at his Wednesday news conference indicated some of what lies below the surface. As he left the affair, the GM told reporters, \"The rivalry is back on.\" The two franchises have something of a contentious history, including most notably the Deflategate drama the Colts prompted after a 2015 loss to New England in the AFC championship game. Ballard's closing line, though, was the closest he came to saying anything critical about the Patriots on Wednesday. \"We were disappointed. Unquestionably, we were disappointed and surprised,\" Ballard told reporters, after McDaniels opted to keep his job as New England's offensive coordinator. \"We had an agreement in place, had two interviews. Both went very well. [We were] very confident even Tuesday morning. Then I got a call Tuesday evening saying he had changed his mind and was going in a different direction.",

          "The offensive coordinator&rsquo;s resume includes success with Tom Brady and a fistful of Super Bowl rings. Ordinarily, that combination would make NFL general managers salivate as they begin to contemplate coaching changes.But after what happened with Josh McDaniels and the Indianapolis Colts last February, has enough time passed for his success to outweigh the ugliness of his nanosecond tenure with Indy?McDaniels &ldquo;is open to potential head coaching opportunities,&rdquo; NFL Network&rsquo;s Ian Rapoport reported Sunday, and he is reportedly on the Cleveland Browns' shortlist of candidates to replace Hue Jackson, who was fired last week. That&rsquo;s an interesting development, given that McDaniels was set to become the coach of the Colts before backing out the night before he was to be introduced in a news conference. McDaniels, 42, opted to remain in New England and reportedly became the league&rsquo;s highest paid coordinator when he agreed to a five-year deal with the team. There also was speculation that he returned because he is Bill Belichick&rsquo;s heir apparent, although Belichick, at 66, shows no signs of retiring to his boat anytime soon.In his weekly appearance on WEEI&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kirk and Callahan&rdquo; show Monday morning, Brady pointed out that McDaniels remains under contract, not that that has previously stopped anyone in pro sports from moving on. &ldquo;Josh will have as much opportunity as anyone out there because he&rsquo;s the best in the league at what he does,&rdquo; Brady said. &ldquo;Everyone is going to want that.",

McCarthy, for instance, is doing himself no favors with his play-calling for Aaron Rodgers, who has passive aggressively questioned his head coach. There&rsquo;s a growing perception that Green Bay is wasting the prime of Rodgers, who turns 35 next month.The Tampa Bay Buccaneers reportedly are &ldquo;nearing a breaking point&rdquo; with Coach Dirk Koetter. Tampa Bay already fired its defensive coordinator and benched quarterback Jameis Winston, and might be running out of people to blame. Over the weekend, ESPN reported that the Ravens' John Harbaugh is on the hot seat; Sunday&rsquo;s loss to the Steelers can&rsquo;t have helped. Other teams that have to be considering their options include the Bills, Jaguars, Cowboys and maybe even the Jets and Broncos.",

          "And those two struggle with the high costs of their prescription medication. Comedian Sarah Silverman tweeted that she \"loved\" the reboot because of how it portrayed the turmoil many families have experienced since Trump was elected president: \"That familiar feeling of the old but w comedy & content so totally of this moment like the angst w/in close families over politics. Hope y'all let go of needing art 2 reflect/express only what u yourself feel. That's not what art's 4.\" Roseanne Barr and John Goodman play spouses Roseanne and Dan Conner. (Adam Rose/ABC) 3. Criticism of how the show inaccurately represents Trump voters Jared Yates Sexton, a seemingly liberal Georgia Southern University professor, tweeted that the reboot presents an \"idealized version\" of the president's base. While the original show provided an honest, \"warts and all look\" at Middle America, he added, the current show glazes over the fact that Roseanne is turning \"a blind eye to Trump's many, many bigoted statements.\" Conservative radio host Ben Shapiro, on the other hand, said the show fails to represent Trump voters because it \"recasts Trump voters as social Leftists who just disagree about economics.\" Like Sexton, he used the word \"fantasy\" to describe the depiction and claimed that it presented the voters as \"people who agree with Hollywood elites on values, but just disagree on economics because they're old white factory workers.\" 4. Disapproval of how the sitcom treats politics Linda Holmes, host of NPR's \"Pop Culture Happy Hour,\" engaged with Saraiya in an online conversation about how the premiere treated politics itself.",

Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s.\nUntil the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals, but a transition to digital television is expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s.\nA standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals."

Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s.\nUntil the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals, but a transition to digital television is expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s.\nA standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals."

In politics, president is a title given to leaders of republican states.\nThe functions exercised by a president vary according to the form of government. In parliamentary republics, they are limited to those of the head of state, and are thus largely ceremonial. In presidential and semi-presidential republics, the role of the president is more prominent, encompassing also (in most cases) the functions of the head of government. In authoritarian regimes, a dictator or leader of a one-party state may also be called a president."

          "OWINGS MILLS, Md. &mdash; For the first time in his career, Terrell Suggs got caught. Years ago, Suggs and teammate Haloti Ngata started &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti&rsquo;s purple, E-Z-Go golf cart to drive to the practice field. Even when Ngata was traded after the 2014 season, Suggs maintained the tradition and, always, someone returned the golf cart to the Under Armour Performance Center patio before Bisciotti got there. But a few days ago, Suggs hopped aboard and quickly realized something was different. &ldquo;Like a kid with his hand stuck in the cookie jar,&rdquo; Suggs said, describing his reaction when he turned around in the front seat Friday and saw Bisciotti sitting on the patio, with his arms up and a confused look on his face. Suggs played it off with a laugh, U-turning to pick up the man who will pay him $6.95&nbsp;million this season, the last year of his contract. Suggs and Bisciotti grinned as Suggs drove them out to the field, but it was another sign: Things weren&rsquo;t how they used to be.&ldquo;Is Terrell Suggs going to get nostalgic, is basically your question? Sentimental?&rdquo; Coach John Harbaugh asked a reporter, who nodded.",

The linebacker, who started all 16&nbsp;games last season and racked up 11 sacks and 37 solo tackles, parried a question about whether he has thought of retirement &mdash; &ldquo;Nah&rdquo; &mdash; and repeated, six times in 10 minutes, that being able to stay with one franchise this long is &ldquo;flattering.&rdquo;Suggs was once a brash, endearing young player who called himself &ldquo;Sizzle&rdquo; and claimed an education from &ldquo;Ball So Hard University.&rdquo; He had teammates who became friends and mentors &mdash; linebacker Ray Lewis, linebacker Adalius &ldquo;AD&rdquo; Thomas, safety Ed Reed, cornerback Chris McAlister and Ngata. As he looks around now, all of those players are gone from the team and most are out of the NFL. Standing there, alone at the mic, the man who has made a living dispensing brutal hits seemed somehow softer.&ldquo;One of the biggest regrets I always tell these younger guys is that I took [former teammates] for granted,&rdquo; Suggs said, looking down.",

Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC."

The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, often having 9 holes. Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup (4.25 inches in diameter). There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass), bunkers (or \"sand traps\"), and various hazards (water, rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement."

          "Phil Mickelson vs. Tiger Woods? You know you'll watch. (Charlie Riedel/Associated Press) Move over, NFL and college football. Make way for a new event that reportedly is coming to Thanksgiving weekend. It's Tiger vs. Phil - or Phil vs. Tiger, depending on your point of view - for a boatload of money, according to ESPN. The highly anticipated showdown between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson will take place either Nov. 23 (Friday) or Nov. 24 at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas, ESPN's Mike Greenberg reported. Rumors about the winner-take-all event have been swirling for a while, with a $10 million payout figure being tossed about. ESPN reported that the purse has not yet been determined, but these guys, you know, don't work cheap. The event will capitalize on a relationship that has thawed after years of frosty competitiveness, and it's a nod to the fact that Woods turns 43 in December and Mickelson is 48. It's now or never. And who doesn't like money? \"It's a ridiculous amount of money,\" Mickelson told Golf.com last month. \"No matter how much money you have, this amount will take both of us out of our comfort zone.\"",

If he retires and decides to pounce on the kind of network job that infrequently opens up, his legacy with the Cowboys is secure, according to his former quarterback. \"You can't really put a number on what Jason Witten has done or meant,\" Romo said. \"He's done really everything a Cowboy could do that you guys see, but also behind closed doors just within the facility and with the team. \"He's the classic example every coach will use for everyone to follow. For every rookie, for every veteran he's the guy that everyone's going to look to and try to emulate. I think that standard will be with the Cowboys long after he's gone. I don't think he even understands yet that that's what he put in place there is a standard of really just your routine and excellence day-to-day that every kid has to abide by now. He really was that guy.\" Witten, no doubt, is considering all those things after asking late last week for more time to make up his mind. An announcement about his future is expected by Wednesday, according to ESPN, and loquacious owner Jerry Jones wasn't offering many details, telling reporters Friday only that Witten \"has some things to think about and discuss with his family.\" So why not walk away?",

          "Joe Nocera is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion and a co-author, with Ben Strauss, of \"Indentured: The Inside Story of the Rebellion Against the NCAA.\" I entered college with a very high opinion of my prose - so high that I felt sure I could write term papers with minimal research by simply \"slinging it.\" Then I got a professor who had no patience for my personal asides and my clever avoidance of the assigned topic. In the margins, he would write \"who cares?\" and grade me accordingly. Mark Leibovich could have used a professor like mine. As evidenced first in \"This Town,\" his 2013 examination of Washington's political culture, and now in \"Big Game: The NFL in Dangerous Times,\" Leibovich is the king of sling. The New York Times Magazine's chief national correspondent has a book-reporting strategy that consists of attending events (Tim Russert's funeral; an NFL owners meeting), hanging around the periphery and writing what he sees, with plenty of snark and personal asides for good measure. He's a good enough writer to keep you from wanting to throw the book against the nearest wall. But if you look closely, you'll realize he has nothing to say. Actually, you don't even have to look that closely. With the National Football League's current problems - notably, the \"taking a knee\" controversy and the knowledge that playing football can inflict brain damage - \"Big Game\" is ostensibly an attempt to answer the question of whether pro football has peaked. As Leibovich writes in the book's preface: \"Are we witnessing the NFL's last gasp as the great spectacle of American life?",

          "I'd probably put the game's long-term survival as a slight favorite over the doom scenarios.\" Then he adds, \"Beyond that, I'm punting.\" He spent four years going to football games, interviewing owners and various NFL pooh-bahs, attending draft days and owners meetings, and writing a more than 350-page book, and he's punting? He is, and he does. (Penguin Press) The book's genesis, Leibovich tells us, came on July 2, 2014, when - are you sitting down for this? - the author got an email from the New England Patriots' star quarterback, Tom Brady. As he tells us many, many times in \"Big Game,\" Leibovich is a Pats fan (\"fanboy\" might be a more appropriate term), and he'd been wanting to profile the great Brady for years; in the email, Brady informed him that he was willing to talk to the author. The email led to a few conversations, and though Brady rarely said anything interesting - you'd be hard-pressed to find a less forthcoming athlete - Leibovich became friendly enough with Brady's father and his trainer that he was able to squeeze out a Times Magazine profile in early 2015. Although Brady gets the star treatment in \"Big Game,\" it's not really a book about the players. The real focus is on the NFL's 32 owners - Leibovich claims to have interviewed half of them, including a drunken go-round with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones - as well as Commissioner Roger Goodell, whom he mocks mercilessly. Still, his problem is that they aren't much more forthcoming than Brady; they don't really tell him anything they wouldn't tell any other journalist on the business-of-football beat. Thus, at the first owners meeting Leibovich writes about, in Boca Raton, Fla., he does the same thing as everyone else covering the meeting: He waits around with the pack of reporters for the owners - or anyone else of interest - to stop and talk to them. Astonishingly, this meeting consumes three full chapters.",

          "I'd probably put the game's long-term survival as a slight favorite over the doom scenarios.\" Then he adds, \"Beyond that, I'm punting.\" He spent four years going to football games, interviewing owners and various NFL pooh-bahs, attending draft days and owners meetings, and writing a more than 350-page book, and he's punting? He is, and he does. (Penguin Press) The book's genesis, Leibovich tells us, came on July 2, 2014, when - are you sitting down for this? - the author got an email from the New England Patriots' star quarterback, Tom Brady. As he tells us many, many times in \"Big Game,\" Leibovich is a Pats fan (\"fanboy\" might be a more appropriate term), and he'd been wanting to profile the great Brady for years; in the email, Brady informed him that he was willing to talk to the author. The email led to a few conversations, and though Brady rarely said anything interesting - you'd be hard-pressed to find a less forthcoming athlete - Leibovich became friendly enough with Brady's father and his trainer that he was able to squeeze out a Times Magazine profile in early 2015. Although Brady gets the star treatment in \"Big Game,\" it's not really a book about the players. The real focus is on the NFL's 32 owners - Leibovich claims to have interviewed half of them, including a drunken go-round with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones - as well as Commissioner Roger Goodell, whom he mocks mercilessly. Still, his problem is that they aren't much more forthcoming than Brady; they don't really tell him anything they wouldn't tell any other journalist on the business-of-football beat. Thus, at the first owners meeting Leibovich writes about, in Boca Raton, Fla., he does the same thing as everyone else covering the meeting: He waits around with the pack of reporters for the owners - or anyone else of interest - to stop and talk to them. Astonishingly, this meeting consumes three full chapters.",

          "In the first chapter we learn that the owners are unhappy with their accommodations in Boca - which Leibovich uses as a strained metaphor for \"something being off-kilter with America's beloved blood sport.\" He reports that New York Giants Chairman Steve Tisch has a gorgeous girlfriend who speaks five languages. And he repeats Goodell's infamous remark, when asked about young football players who had recently died: \"There is risk in sitting on the couch.\" Much of the second chapter is spent describing a handful of owners as they parade through the media gauntlet. Jones is \"brash and rascally.\" Mark Davis, the owner of the Oakland Raiders - who is determined to move the franchise to greener pastures - is treated by the other owners \"like their pet rock.\" Leibovich gives Woody Johnson, the Jets owner (and current ambassador to Britain), the nickname \"Wood Man.\" The third chapter is padded with an eight-page description of the other reporters working the meeting, searching for nuggets they can deliver to their readers or viewers. \"The Nugget Industrial Complex,\" he snarks, even though he is looking for his own nuggets. And so it goes. Leibovich tackles the concussion issue by going to Hall of Fame ceremonies and talking to retired players about their physical and mental problems. Nothing wrong with that, except that the serious discussion is overwhelmed by pages of pointless narration.",
          "Are these the last days of the NFL?",
          "At the 2017 Super Bowl, Leibovich describes the parties he went to. He actually has a sentence that reads, \"And this explains everything about everything - or perhaps nothing at all.\" To be blunt, I learned nothing about the state of pro football from reading \"Big Game\" that I didn't already know. But oh, what I learned from Leibovich's slinging it! I know that Goodell doesn't like pizza. I know that Brady speaks Portuguese to his kids. I know that Leibovich hates the Washington Redskins almost as much as he loves the Patriots. I know that Jones was once a shoe salesman. As my old professor might have put it: Who cares?

The itch: If you're Nick Saban, how badly do you want to show that you can be a very big deal on two platforms? Or is there a sense of satisfaction with what he has accomplished? The downside: Going to the Giants would mean that Saban would have to actually, you know, work for someone. In Alabama, there's Nick Saban and everyone else. Whatever he's thinking, he wasn't tipping his hand after the Crimson Tide beat Georgia in overtime Monday and he was asked to take stock of how much longer he plans to coach. \"As long as I feel like I can do a good job for the players and the team - from an energy level, from a focus level, from a concentration level, from providing a good staff of people around them to help them have success,\" he said. \"These are things that I know that I cannot do forever, but they're certainly things that I have enjoyed and hope I can continue to enjoy in the future.\"",

Salary: Jon Gruden just signed a 10-year contract valued at $100 million, which is in the neighborhood of Saban's $11.1 million deal that runs through 2025 at 'Bama. At Saban's age, a 10-year deal seems unlikely. History: It would be tempting to turn around the Giants and build a dynasty there, but Saban is 12 years older than Gruden. It might be more tempting to stay in Tuscaloosa, where Bear Bryant won six national titles. [Alabama's dominant recruiting translates into a constantly rolling Tide] Ease: The Alabama team appears loaded for next season and breaking the tie with Bryant would seem to be within fairly easy reach. The Giants are coming off a 3-13 season. More history: The last time he was in the NFL, his Miami Dolphins went 15-17 during a tumultuous tenure in which he said he wouldn't be leaving for Alabama - until he did. In 11 seasons with the Tide, he is 132-20.",

          "New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady warms up before the NFL Super Bowl 52 football game against the Philadelphia Eagles Sunday, Feb. 4, 2018, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) Tom Brady has a plan for your life. Good health. Joy. Peak performance. And plenty of avocado ice cream. It's all part of \"The TB12 Method,\" Brady's best-selling \"athlete's bible\" and lifestyle brand, which he credits with helping him stay at the top of his game at age 40. And it appears to work. Brady and his New England Patriots teammates are favored to win Super Bowl LII, which would be their sixth NFL championship in eight tries under Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. But Brady is after something bigger than football, said his friend Gotham Chopra - something bigger than wins and losses. Brady's on a spiritual quest. Football has become Brady's religion, said Chopra, a filmmaker whose latest project is \"Tom vs. Time,\" a behind-the-scenes documentary series about the quarterback's preparations for this past NFL season. \"What's really at the epicenter of it is this devotional love for the game,\" Chopra said. \"It is his vocation - it's what gives his life meaning and purpose.\" The first two episodes of the series, which premiered Jan. 25 on Facebook Watch (the social network's video platform), look at Brady's physical and mental preparation. Future episodes will focus on other areas, including his spiritual side.",

          "I'd probably put the game's long-term survival as a slight favorite over the doom scenarios.\" Then he adds, \"Beyond that, I'm punting.\" He spent four years going to football games, interviewing owners and various NFL pooh-bahs, attending draft days and owners meetings, and writing a more than 350-page book, and he's punting? He is, and he does. (Penguin Press) The book's genesis, Leibovich tells us, came on July 2, 2014, when - are you sitting down for this? - the author got an email from the New England Patriots' star quarterback, Tom Brady. As he tells us many, many times in \"Big Game,\" Leibovich is a Pats fan (\"fanboy\" might be a more appropriate term), and he'd been wanting to profile the great Brady for years; in the email, Brady informed him that he was willing to talk to the author. The email led to a few conversations, and though Brady rarely said anything interesting - you'd be hard-pressed to find a less forthcoming athlete - Leibovich became friendly enough with Brady's father and his trainer that he was able to squeeze out a Times Magazine profile in early 2015. Although Brady gets the star treatment in \"Big Game,\" it's not really a book about the players. The real focus is on the NFL's 32 owners - Leibovich claims to have interviewed half of them, including a drunken go-round with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones - as well as Commissioner Roger Goodell, whom he mocks mercilessly. Still, his problem is that they aren't much more forthcoming than Brady; they don't really tell him anything they wouldn't tell any other journalist on the business-of-football beat. Thus, at the first owners meeting Leibovich writes about, in Boca Raton, Fla., he does the same thing as everyone else covering the meeting: He waits around with the pack of reporters for the owners - or anyone else of interest - to stop and talk to them. Astonishingly, this meeting consumes three full chapters.",

Taylor echoed his former coordinator on social media, tweeting, &ldquo;What he said!!! !&rdquo;Belichick&rsquo;s relationship with Taylor was special, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he wasn&rsquo;t complimentary to Mack. He just wasn&rsquo;t that complimentary.&ldquo;He gets after everybody. He&rsquo;s a very disruptive player, so he turns it over on sacks, strip-sacks, fumbles, tipped balls, interceptions,&rdquo; Belichick said of Mack. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a really strong run player, he&rsquo;s a good pass rusher, he&rsquo;s got speed, he&rsquo;s got power. He&rsquo;s very aware and instinctive. So, yeah, he does more than sack the quarterback &mdash; he knocks the ball away from him, but he knocks it off running backs, too."

          "He&rsquo;s tough.&rdquo;Given the length and introspection of his answer, it&rsquo;s clear that Belichick does like what he sees from Mack. As for comparisons, it&rsquo;s probably a little early. At 27, Mack has 246 total tackles and 45.5 sacks through five seasons. Taylor finished his career with 132.5 sacks, a stat that wasn&rsquo;t official pre-Taylor (he unofficially had 9.5 as a rookie), and also won an MVP award. In addition, he entered folklore by changing the way left tackle was played, as Michael Lewis memorably described in &ldquo;The Blind Side.&rdquo; After Taylor&rsquo;s rise, the left tackle&rsquo;s job increasingly focused on protecting star quarterbacks like Joe Theismann, whose leg Taylor accidentally broke in a &ldquo;Monday Night Football&rdquo; game.Belichick hasn&rsquo;t always shied away from comparing Taylor to modern stars, though. Last year, he couldn&rsquo;t say enough about the Texans' J.J. Watt, who has 329 total tackles and 83 sacks through eight seasons (two of which were shortened by injury).&ldquo;Motor, effort, strength, quickness, instincts, the ability to make game-changing plays at critical times in the game,&rdquo; Belichick said of Watt and Taylor. &ldquo;Knowing when the big play &mdash; critical third-down or fourth-quarter play or red-area play &mdash; knowing those critical plays in the game. As good as Taylor would play all game, that was the time when he would play at his best.&rdquo;And Watt?&ldquo;He wins with his quickness in the pass rush,&rdquo; Belichick said.",

          "New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady warms up before the NFL Super Bowl 52 football game against the Philadelphia Eagles Sunday, Feb. 4, 2018, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) Tom Brady has a plan for your life. Good health. Joy. Peak performance. And plenty of avocado ice cream. It's all part of \"The TB12 Method,\" Brady's best-selling \"athlete's bible\" and lifestyle brand, which he credits with helping him stay at the top of his game at age 40. And it appears to work. Brady and his New England Patriots teammates are favored to win Super Bowl LII, which would be their sixth NFL championship in eight tries under Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. But Brady is after something bigger than football, said his friend Gotham Chopra - something bigger than wins and losses. Brady's on a spiritual quest. Football has become Brady's religion, said Chopra, a filmmaker whose latest project is \"Tom vs. Time,\" a behind-the-scenes documentary series about the quarterback's preparations for this past NFL season. \"What's really at the epicenter of it is this devotional love for the game,\" Chopra said. \"It is his vocation - it's what gives his life meaning and purpose.\" The first two episodes of the series, which premiered Jan. 25 on Facebook Watch (the social network's video platform), look at Brady's physical and mental preparation. Future episodes will focus on other areas, including his spiritual side.",

          "The next one airs Sunday. \"I do want to know the whys in life,\" Brady said in a version of the spiritual episode, according to the New York Times. \"I do want to know why we're here, where we're going; trying to find that deeper purpose. To live it, through sports in a very authentic way, makes so much sense to me.\" [In a tough sports town, baptisms and Bible studies fuel many of the Eagles' stars] For Chopra, son of best-selling spiritual writer Deepak Chopra and a devoted Boston sports fan, seeing sports as a religion makes sense. Both create community, have saints and rituals, and take place on hallowed ground. And - in a polarized nation - both can unite disparate groups of people, at least for a few hours. Sports might bring people together better than religion, said Daniel Wann, a psychology professor at Murray State University in Kentucky. People who might never talk to one another in real life can bond at a sporting event. \"It has the ability to integrate people from an incredibly diverse set of backgrounds,\" Wann said. \"I don't know any pastime that does that better than fandom.\" The Patriots certainly have a devoted group of fans. They have their own creed: \"In Bill We Trust,\" a sign of their unshakable faith in Belichick, who has led his teams to more playoff victories than any other coach in NFL history. And Brady has been the chief apostle of the Patriot Way - the team's combination of intense preparation, relentless focus and ruthless determination to win, summed up by the phrase \"Do your job.\" Fans have bought in with near-religious devotion, said Chris Beneke, professor of history at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass. People invest a lot of hope in the team, Beneke said.",

          "Richard Sherman is set to become a free agent after his release by the Seahawks. (Elaine Thompson/Associated Press) The dismantling of the Seattle Seahawks, the mini-NFL-dynasty version, continued Friday with the exit of cornerback Richard Sherman. No one should be the least bit surprised, because everyone should have seen this coming. It was clear since late in the 2017 regular season that the deconstruction of the Seahawks as everybody had come to know them was at hand. But now that process is accelerating, with the Seahawks agreeing this week to trade defensive end Michael Bennett to the Philadelphia Eagles and informing Sherman that he would be released Friday. And it is notable in terms of what comes next for the team and Sherman. [The Michael Bennett trade shows the Eagles, as they promised, aren't standing pat] The Seahawks, as a team of lasting significance, were not the New England Patriots. Not anything close. But they were pretty good. They won one Super Bowl and came within an ill-fated play call at the 1-yard line from beating the Patriots in another. They were annual contenders. And they were interesting, with a group of players who were thoughtful and opinionated and engaging along with being productive on the field. Sherman was a big part of that. \"We've had the spotlight for a long time,\" Sherman said after an October game this past season. \"We've had the spotlight on us every game, every week.",

          "Richard Sherman is set to become a free agent after his release by the Seahawks. (Elaine Thompson/Associated Press) The dismantling of the Seattle Seahawks, the mini-NFL-dynasty version, continued Friday with the exit of cornerback Richard Sherman. No one should be the least bit surprised, because everyone should have seen this coming. It was clear since late in the 2017 regular season that the deconstruction of the Seahawks as everybody had come to know them was at hand. But now that process is accelerating, with the Seahawks agreeing this week to trade defensive end Michael Bennett to the Philadelphia Eagles and informing Sherman that he would be released Friday. And it is notable in terms of what comes next for the team and Sherman. [The Michael Bennett trade shows the Eagles, as they promised, aren't standing pat] The Seahawks, as a team of lasting significance, were not the New England Patriots. Not anything close. But they were pretty good. They won one Super Bowl and came within an ill-fated play call at the 1-yard line from beating the Patriots in another. They were annual contenders. And they were interesting, with a group of players who were thoughtful and opinionated and engaging along with being productive on the field. Sherman was a big part of that. \"We've had the spotlight for a long time,\" Sherman said after an October game this past season. \"We've had the spotlight on us every game, every week.",

          "NEW ORLEANS - An NFL season that has brimmed with a smorgasbord of sparkle found itself a capstone Sunday in the Superdome. If the NFL product has come into question for various reasons, here came a hilt of product development. The Los Angeles Rams and the New Orleans Saints got together and lent a slew of treats with their highbrow skills. Eyeballs luxuriated. Punters barely played, which is nothing against punters. Possibilities abounded, including one where Drew Brees went out to catch a pass - he didn't get open - and one where a punter lumbered on a Rams fake field goal attempt. (He didn't make it, and he also didn't punt until the fourth quarter.) By the time the Saints had gone to 7-1 and left the Rams at 8-1 with New Orleans's 45-35 win, some realities had hardened: The Saints really have stormed forth from when Tampa Bay ruined their opener so alarmingly at the time, the Rams possess the stomach to reach 35-35 after they have trailed 35-14, as happened Sunday, and the participants had a goose bump of a time. \"My upbringing, where I came from, those are the games you live for,\" said Michael Thomas, the New Orleans wide receiver whose 72-yard touchdown catch with 3:52 left made the place literally shake. \"That's how I like.",
          "Saints and Rams show off the best the NFL has to offer",
          "I like the big stage. I don't like the quiet games where you're expected to win. I like being the underdog and going and taking stock. It makes the game more fun, makes it more intense, adds more flavor to it and makes everybody honest.\" [NFL Week 9: Aaron Rodgers faces Tom Brady in Sunday night duel] Honestly, he had just caught 12 passes for 211 yards, breaking a Saints record by Wes Chandler that stood for 39 years. Then again, this game felt bound to yield something like that. From the get-go, when the Saints went 75 yards on 10 plays, then the Rams went 71 on six, then the Saints went 75 on eight, then the Rams went 75 on six, the game felt like state-of-the-art American football, even if New Orleans Coach Sean Payton likened it to the three-down Canadian Football League, where first and second down matter intensively. A festival of geometric wonder played with seemingly every angle, the game pitted a 54-year-old coach whose brain stirs geekily with football plays against a 32-year-old coach whose brain stirs geekily with football plays, all of which is about as 2018 as it gets. \"Can't wait to go back, look at this film, figure out what we can do to be better,\" said that 32-year-old coach, the Rams' Sean McVay. He could have stopped that statement at the word \"film,\" and all 73,086 in attendance might have nodded.",
          "Both teams' big dreams remained rational. The idea of a daydream season for Brees at 39 remained plausible. The idea of Brees at 39 and the Rams' Jared Goff at 24 proved sellable. If they meet in an NFC championship game, that would seem relishable, seeing how they combined for 53-for-76 passing for 737 yards and seven touchdowns, with Brees at 25 for 36 for 346 yards and four, and Goff at 28 for 40 for 391 yards and three. \"I just think that his command and his overall presence, you can see why he is a first-ballot Hall of Famer,\" McVay said of Brees. [Redskins' winning streak ends with ugly, injury-riddled performance] In the NFL's first meeting in Week 9 or later between two teams averaging 33 or more points - Saints 33.4, Rams 33.0 - the Rams wound up getting 483 total yards, and the Saints wound up inching past that near the end for 487. When a defender, Saints linebacker Alex Anzalone, made a key interception 59 seconds to halftime, it's as if he stood up for all defenders to say, We're still here, too. If this was football as it's played these days, it's football with gasps. A fourth-and-one in the first quarter might not seem a traditional time to have Brees flip it to the Saints' wildly athletic handyman, Taysom Hill, then have Hill look to throw for Brees before seeing a lane and running for a first down, but time has marched on, and that's what happened.",
          "A third-and-one while trailing 35-27 in the fourth might not seem a traditional time to have Goff fake and step back with a threat of excessive cuteness, then find Cooper Kupp underneath, but time has marched on, just as Kupp marched up the left sideline for a 41-yard touchdown that helped tie the game. On and on they went, except they could have gone on for hours more without ceasing to entertain. \"You're constantly working off pictures from the last series,\" Payton said - \"highlighting, crossing off [plays], that kind of thing.\" All the while, Brees felt that edging the Rams would require \"near-perfect\" form, all the way until the four-minute mark when he read Thomas on the left with one man in front and the safeties tilting elsewhere, and lofted the 72-yarder that wrought bedlam. So Brees wound up reeling off the highbrow stats such as \"[58] percent on third downs, that's huge,\" and \"5 for 5 [for touchdowns] in the red zone, that's huge,\" and \"running the football, [141] yards rushing, that's huge.\" Said Alvin Kamara, who rushed for 82 yards and caught four integral passes for 34, \"When we operate how I know we can operate, it's hard to do anything with us.\" That merit went for the Saints, the Rams and the product.

Because of his numerous accomplishments and accolades, many analysts and sportswriters consider Brady to be among the greatest quarterbacks of all time.After playing college football for the University of Michigan, Brady was drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. Due to his late draft selection, Brady is considered to be the biggest \"steal\" in the history of the NFL Draft. In Brady's sixteen seasons as a starter, he has quarterbacked the Patriots to eight Super Bowl appearances, the most for any player in history. Brady is also one of only two quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl in their first season as a starter, the other being Kurt Warner."

          "No game may challenge the Washington Redskins' defense more than Monday night&rsquo;s meeting with the Saints in New Orleans. The Saints are averaging 34 points a game, third-most in the NFL, and they did it without running back Mark Ingram, who rushed for 1,124 yards last season. Ingram returns this week from suspension, making an already explosive offense even more powerful.But as dominant as New Orleans is on offense, its defense will give up yards. The 30 points the Saints are allowing each game are the fourth-worst in the league. The Redskins will be able to score, but they will have to limit the Saints&rsquo; big plays. If they fall too far behind, they are not built to catch up quickly. Control Alvin Kamara\n         \nIn just his second year, the Saints running back has become one of the NFL&rsquo;s most explosive players &mdash; third in the league in receptions and eighth in rushing yards. Washington has to know where he is at all times.",

He is one of only two players in NFL history to have won five Super Bowls (along with defensive player Charles Haley), and he is the only player to have won them all with a single franchise. Because of his numerous accomplishments and accolades, many analysts and sportswriters consider Brady to be among the greatest quarterbacks of all time.After playing college football for the University of Michigan, Brady was drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. Due to his late draft selection, Brady is considered to be the biggest \"steal\" in the history of the NFL Draft. In Brady's sixteen seasons as a starter, he has quarterbacked the Patriots to eight Super Bowl appearances, the most for any player in history. Brady is also one of only two quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl in their first season as a starter, the other being Kurt Warner."

          "Tom Brady spent last week in Qatar in connection with the Best Buddies charity. (2022 Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy via Getty Images) In the final episode of his \"Tom vs. Time\" Facebook series last month, Tom Brady sounded like a 40-year-old husband and father of three with plenty of interests besides football. Now, on the week when most NFL teams begin their offseason workouts, he's acting like one. The question is: how much should anyone read into that? Despite an MVP season and another Super Bowl appearance, Brady still has not committed to playing in the 2018 season, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports. The report is fueled by Brady's absence from voluntary offseason workouts and the residual fallout from the rumors of discord swirling about him, Rob Gronkowski, Bill Belichick and Brady's health guru, Alex Guerrero. Many people, Schefter reported, believe that Brady will play, but there is less certainty than usual. \"My money would be on him playing football for the foreseeable future, but what goes on away from the football field, I don't know,\" one source told ESPN. \"I don't know.\" Another person told ESPN, \"we're dealing with a human being. Things can change. But I do believe he will be playing.\" A Pro Football Talk report bolsters that point of view, with an unnamed source telling Mike Florio that Brady is planning a summer passing camp with teammates sometime before the opening of training camp in July. Still, you're to be forgiven if you fear that we're in full-on Brett Favre territory again with the \"will he or won't he play\" stuff.",

And, to add to the mix, Brady has not signed his usual contract extension. Yet. So where are we? Might as well set up camp on Brady's lawn. Not that he's home. He was in Qatar with his family last weekend. It should also be noted that he has skipped part of offseason work before - in 2008, 2009 and 2010. ESPN's report noted that he plans to spend more time with Guerrero this offseason, and that Brady has said he wants to play until he is 45. The Patriots evidently believed him, trading backups Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett, which means they may well be looking for Brady's successor in next week's draft. So we'll leave you with this. \"Again,\" Brady told People, \"I still love playing and hopefully I can play for a while.\" Ah, that pesky \"hopefully.\"",

          "There has been speculation, too, about the future of Gronkowski, who has not attended the first three days of offseason work, and about his possible displeasure with his contract. And, to add to the mix, Brady has not signed his usual contract extension. Yet. So where are we? Might as well set up camp on Brady's lawn. Not that he's home. He was in Qatar with his family last weekend. It should also be noted that he has skipped part of offseason work before - in 2008, 2009 and 2010. ESPN's report noted that he plans to spend more time with Guerrero this offseason, and that Brady has said he wants to play until he is 45. The Patriots evidently believed him, trading backups Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett, which means they may well be looking for Brady's successor in next week's draft. So we'll leave you with this. \"Again,\" Brady told People, \"I still love playing and hopefully I can play for a while.\" Ah, that pesky \"hopefully.\"",
