          "Adrian Peterson had 11 carries for 56 yards against the Broncos. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) Experience has told Adrian Peterson his body should have ached Saturday morning. The days after games have never been great for the Washington Redskins' new running back, especially for a player who has made a career thundering through lines, all but looking for contact. But after playing his first game in nine months Friday night, Peterson said he was surprised that his body didn't throb more. Other than some soreness in his neck, he actually felt good. \"I could have had another 15 carries,\" he said. The 11 rushes he had for 56 yards in Friday's loss to the Denver Broncos have become the story of the preseason for Washington. Few could have expected the 33-year-old, onetime MVP, who went unsigned through the summer, to look like the player he was in his prime. Not with the injuries that damaged his past two seasons. After watching the tape of Peterson's performance, Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said he noted his new back's vision, patience and acceleration.",
          "Adrian Peterson feels strong after Redskins debut: \u2018I could have had another 15 carries.\u2019",
          "But the thing he liked most was the way Peterson clutched the ball tight against his body. \"Ball security is big for us,\" Gruden said. Peterson actually enjoyed watching the film, as well, something he didn't think he would after the game, believing he hadn't run as well as he wanted. He changed his mind Saturday when he noticed small mistakes that easily could be corrected. \"If I was a little more patient on the stretch play, then I could have gotten underneath, or maybe if the receiver had stayed on the block longer, then it would have been a 50-yard run instead of a 13-yard run,\" he said, adding that he stressed to several players the importance of staying with plays until their end. \"So it's good to get those mistakes out of the way and clean it up.\" Gruden said Sunday that he wants to see Peterson in more situations than straight runs, to see how he moves on pitches and even a few passing routes. Peterson, who said he has been \"cramming\" his new playbook, has been almost defiant in response to suggestions his body is too worn down for him to be effective anymore. When he arrived last week he said those who questioned him \"don't know football.\" He was a little tamer Sunday but described \"sitting on the couch at the house,\" listening to people on television \"giving their opinion.\""

Former Broad Run High quarterback Connor Jessop joined the team Sunday and appeared at practice wearing No. 2. Jessop, a Division II all-American at Shepherd University, went undrafted last spring but participated in the Redskins' rookie minicamp. He was not signed after the minicamp. To make room for Jessop, Washington waived wide receiver Allenzae Staggers, who had been signed by the team last week. The Redskins also waived defensive back Darius Hillary, a veteran of the Cleveland Browns' and Oakland' Raiders' practice squads who had been signed last week. They added former Arizona State defensive tackle JoJo Wicker, considered a sleeper before the draft, who went unpicked. He was cut by Detroit last week.",

Injuries complicate position battle With cuts coming next weekend, Gruden said he is watching several position battles as he and the front office try to make their final decisions for the 53-man roster. No fight might be more contested than the one for the final two or three wide receiver spots, a tussle that is complicated by the fact that two of the most interesting prospects - former Ram Brian Quick and Cam Sims, an undrafted rookie from Alabama - have missed several days with leg injuries. Neither has practiced since the second preseason game against the New York Jets. \"Quick started off really strong in camp and then had that thigh, and Cam, too, had his big game and then he hurt his thigh,\" Gruden said. \"Unfortunately they are unavailable to participate, so it makes it very tough, especially like a young guy like Cam who was coming and you see the progress but then it gets stopped and we got to hope he gets ready soon. \"I like them both,\" Gruden added. \"There's a lot to like about both those guys, and we might possibly keep them both, so we will wait and see.",

The days after games have never been great for the Washington Redskins' new running back, especially for a player who has made a career thundering through lines, all but looking for contact. But after playing his first game in nine months Friday night, Peterson said he was surprised that his body didn't throb more. Other than some soreness in his neck, he actually felt good. \"I could have had another 15 carries,\" he said. The 11 rushes he had for 56 yards in Friday's loss to the Denver Broncos have become the story of the preseason for Washington. Few could have expected the 33-year-old, onetime MVP, who went unsigned through the summer, to look like the player he was in his prime. Not with the injuries that damaged his past two seasons. After watching the tape of Peterson's performance, Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said he noted his new back's vision, patience and acceleration.",

In his or her three-year playing career, a Junior Pee Wee player today (should they be reading the news) has been exposed to more coverage of brain damage and football than the Super Bowl's oldest starter, Tom Brady, could have seen, total, between when he was born in 1977 and drafted in 2000. Between the Junior Pee Wee player and 40-year-old Brady, there's a generation of football players who have made pivotal life choices about the sport in a decade in which the conversation has changed, with each cohort being better informed than the last. The youngest starter in this year's game, 23-year-old Patriots linebacker Elandon Roberts, would have been exposed to more stories about brain injuries and football during four years of high school alone than were published in the 22 years before Brady made the decision to go pro. [Rob Gronkowski listed with concussion, giving Patriots fans some early Super Bowl worries] That makes Roberts part of the first wave of NFL players with enough information available to make more informed health decisions about whether to play in high school, college and the pro leagues, assuming they had the time and opportunity to consult it. For this post, we're assuming the players who started in the conference championships will also start the Super Bowl.

The younger players in Super Bowl 52 could have at least been aware that there's something called \"chronic traumatic encephalopathy\" and that it's tied to football and other contact sports. Each subsequent class of players has been exposed to more and better coverage. In the decade since CTE first made headlines, a growing body of research and reporting has proved its deeper ties with brain trauma and football. The depth and breadth of the risks is becoming clearer. [A new study shows that hits to the head, not concussions, cause CTE] Today's incoming middle school athletes have spent their entire lives in a universe that is aware of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Regardless of what steps youth football organizations and the NFL take, the conversation around the sport has gained another dimension. The generation trying out for every level of football now will be making a better-informed decision than players in the Feb. 4 Super Bowl did.",

          "We included Junior Pee Wee players because it's a pivotal moment in the decision whether to play football - that, and all other categories, can be assumed to be measuring parents' exposure and general cultural awareness as well as a player's specific reading opportunities. The chart likely overstates coverage in the '80s and '90s, when there were myriad stories about brain damage in accidents and among \"punch drunk\" boxers which mentioned football in an oblique manner. That may be balanced by an overall increase in the number of newspaper stories published later in the time period. Compare the age curve in that chart with Feb. 4's Super Bowl starters, whose average age is nearly 28. On average, they were born in 1990 and were already finishing high school just as the New York Times published Alan Schwarz's front-page story, \"Expert Ties Ex-Player's Suicide to Brain Damage From Football.\" The research that would change our understanding of that brain damage, known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, wouldn't hit the mainstream until a typical Super Bowl starter had already committed to the sport. Forensic pathologist Bennet Omalu's initial description of the disease in a football player was published in 2005, but not many prospective football players would have been reading the journal \"Neurosurgery.\" The scattered early stories wouldn't give way to the flood of coverage we see today until the following decade. Even coverage of concussions, which have been part of the medical lexicon for the sport's entire history, has changed.",

In his or her three-year playing career, a Junior Pee Wee player today (should they be reading the news) has been exposed to more coverage of brain damage and football than the Super Bowl's oldest starter, Tom Brady, could have seen, total, between when he was born in 1977 and drafted in 2000. Between the Junior Pee Wee player and 40-year-old Brady, there's a generation of football players who have made pivotal life choices about the sport in a decade in which the conversation has changed, with each cohort being better informed than the last. The youngest starter in this year's game, 23-year-old Patriots linebacker Elandon Roberts, would have been exposed to more stories about brain injuries and football during four years of high school alone than were published in the 22 years before Brady made the decision to go pro. [Rob Gronkowski listed with concussion, giving Patriots fans some early Super Bowl worries] That makes Roberts part of the first wave of NFL players with enough information available to make more informed health decisions about whether to play in high school, college and the pro leagues, assuming they had the time and opportunity to consult it. For this post, we're assuming the players who started in the conference championships will also start the Super Bowl. We're using a count of Washington Post and New York Times articles that mention \"brain damage,\"  \"brain injury\" and \"football'' as a rough estimate of media coverage, because they're searchable in a consistent format and over a time period long enough to cover all current players. The below chart shows how many such news stories a person of a given age could have seen, had they been paying attention.",

          "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles, who missed a game in 2013 with a concussion, throws as he's hit by the Minnesota Vikings' Eric Kendricks on Jan. 21 in Philadelphia. (Matt Slocum/AP) The 52nd Super Bowl on Feb. 4 will be one of the last to feature a generation of players who can reasonably claim they didn't know about the dangers of repeated head trauma when they started playing. In his or her three-year playing career, a Junior Pee Wee player today (should they be reading the news) has been exposed to more coverage of brain damage and football than the Super Bowl's oldest starter, Tom Brady, could have seen, total, between when he was born in 1977 and drafted in 2000. Between the Junior Pee Wee player and 40-year-old Brady, there's a generation of football players who have made pivotal life choices about the sport in a decade in which the conversation has changed, with each cohort being better informed than the last. The youngest starter in this year's game, 23-year-old Patriots linebacker Elandon Roberts, would have been exposed to more stories about brain injuries and football during four years of high school alone than were published in the 22 years before Brady made the decision to go pro. [Rob Gronkowski listed with concussion, giving Patriots fans some early Super Bowl worries] That makes Roberts part of the first wave of NFL players with enough information available to make more informed health decisions about whether to play in high school, college and the pro leagues, assuming they had the time and opportunity to consult it. For this post, we're assuming the players who started in the conference championships will also start the Super Bowl. We're using a count of Washington Post and New York Times articles that mention \"brain damage,\"  \"brain injury\" and \"football'' as a rough estimate of media coverage, because they're searchable in a consistent format and over a time period long enough to cover all current players. The below chart shows how many such news stories a person of a given age could have seen, had they been paying attention.",

(American Alliance of Football) David Dixon tried it in 1982, Vince McMahon tried it in 2001 and now Charlie Ebersol will try it in 2019. Entertainment entrepreneurs have long been convinced professional football was a sport not just reserved for fall, and fans would take to teams and a start-up league that provided football outside the NFL and college football seasons. Ebersol, the son of XFL executive Dick Ebersol, will lead the latest attempt at professional spring football with the American Alliance of Football, an eight-team start-up set to kick off in 2019. \"This is a massive gap in the market,\" Ebersol said during the Alliance's rollout on Tuesday. \"This is a marketplace of tens of millions of Americans who have been telling us for decades that they want to see high quality football longer than the football season.\" But the AAF's launch comes with the game in the midst of an existential crisis, according to some experts, or in the belly of a severe market correction, according to others. Both groups agree the news surrounding football certainly isn't good. Amid discoveries that link football to degenerative brain disease - chronic traumatic encephalopathy - youth football participation dropped nearly 30 percent between 2008 and 2013, according to data collected by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Four states will consider legislation this year to ban tackle football for children 12 and under. High school player participation is down 4.5 percent in the last decade, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.",

          "[Convinced he's living with CTE, former NFL running back Larry Johnson battles self-destructive impulses] NFL viewership during a season marked by gruesome injuries and political discord dropped 10 percent this past season, leading some who study the league and its market to suggest America's appetite for football isn't as strong as it once was. \"Tackle football has real problems,\" Southern Utah University economics professor David Berri said. \"You want the [new] league to last 50 years, I'm not sure tackle football is going to be here in 50 years.\" And beside football's continuing public relations trial, the AAF will enter a market already stuffed with gridiron alternatives. College football is a multibillion-dollar business. The Arena Football League still exists, although it's set to play this season with just four teams. High school football owns Friday nights in a large portion of the South and Midwest, and McMahon, the WWE and XFL founder, is reviving his league in 2020. \"I live in Big Ten country,\" said Scott Tainsky, who studies sports economics at Wayne State University. \"On any given Saturday, you're looking at hundreds of thousands of fans who are going to games and tens of millions more watching on TV.\" So is there really a market for more football? Maybe, Tainsky says, but certainly not the kind of football spectators are used to seeing.",

(American Alliance of Football) David Dixon tried it in 1982, Vince McMahon tried it in 2001 and now Charlie Ebersol will try it in 2019. Entertainment entrepreneurs have long been convinced professional football was a sport not just reserved for fall, and fans would take to teams and a start-up league that provided football outside the NFL and college football seasons. Ebersol, the son of XFL executive Dick Ebersol, will lead the latest attempt at professional spring football with the American Alliance of Football, an eight-team start-up set to kick off in 2019. \"This is a massive gap in the market,\" Ebersol said during the Alliance's rollout on Tuesday. \"This is a marketplace of tens of millions of Americans who have been telling us for decades that they want to see high quality football longer than the football season.\" But the AAF's launch comes with the game in the midst of an existential crisis, according to some experts, or in the belly of a severe market correction, according to others. Both groups agree the news surrounding football certainly isn't good. Amid discoveries that link football to degenerative brain disease - chronic traumatic encephalopathy - youth football participation dropped nearly 30 percent between 2008 and 2013, according to data collected by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Four states will consider legislation this year to ban tackle football for children 12 and under. High school player participation is down 4.5 percent in the last decade, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.",

          "Danny Johnson made the Redskins' 53-man roster. (Nick Wass/AP) Danny Johnson had to be talked into playing high school football. Basketball was his first love, and the football coach at his Louisiana school had to beg Johnson, a well-known middle-school athlete, to play. Eight years later, Johnson, a cornerback out of Southern University, is one of two undrafted rookies to make the Washington Redskins' 53-man roster. \"It still is surreal to me,\" Johnson said. \"I can't even explain how it feels. I don't have the words to explain how I feel, just being a small kid from Jackson, Louisiana, and I'm just blessed to be here. \"It means a lot, especially after not hearing my name called during the draft.\" The tears were flowing back in Louisiana on Saturday as cuts were being made around the NFL before a 4 p.m. roster deadline. Johnson and wide receiver Cam Sims were the only undrafted rookies to stick with the Redskins. Johnson has a group text with a number of family members, and he broke the news there instead of making individual calls. \"I screamed, I cried,\" Danny's mother, Lisa Ferguson, said. \"It was just a happy moment. That's like a dream there.\" [Kapri Bibbs among eight players signed to Redskins practice squad] Johnson's success isn't a complete surprise to the family considering they have grown accustomed to his persistent hard work and determination, but they never envisioned an NFL career.",

I feel like athletes in general, especially football and basketball players in particular, would love the sport if they knew more about it. It's all strategy-based. You come up with a good strategy to execute, and once you find a good strategy, you can mediate on that and visualize what happens, and it makes it fun, just like shuffleboard.\" Davis, who has his own curling shoes and broom and estimates he has been curling about 25 times, was USA Curling's honorary captain at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics and traveled to Sochi in 2014 to cheer on the team. He said he hopes to be in PyeongChang. I'll take the \"lead.\" #curling A post shared by Vernon Davis (@vernondavis85) on Mar 7, 2017 at 9:52am PST \"It's one of those things like golf,\" he said. \"You get out when you can, and unless you put a lot of time into it, you can't become great at it.

He has until this coming Tuesday, Nov. 13, to sign with the Steelers if he wants to play football at all this season, but there could be significant financial incentives for him not to do so.As Fowler pointed out, the Steelers would be very unlikely to place a third straight franchise tag on Bell after this season, because that would obligate them to pay him more than $20 million, an exorbitant sum for a non-quarterback, for the 2019 campaign. The team would have the option, though, of applying a transition tag, which would mean paying him 120 percent of his previous salary.Because Bell has not been paid anything this season, that salary figure could come from the 2017 season, when he made $12.1 million, so the transition tag would garner him around $14.5 million next year.",

          "If we don't show recruits that we've committed and invested in our football program, then the messaging is that, and so we've got some work to do in that area.\" Also unpalatable for recruits is the abundance of elbow room during games at Scott Stadium, where attendance has been sagging for years. Scott Stadium holds 61,500, but the Cavaliers have announced a home crowd of more than 40,000 only three times during Mendenhall's two seasons: 49,270 for his first game at the school; 48,609 for last season's regular season finale against Virginia Tech; and 40,882 for a Week 7 matchup against North Carolina in 2016. Virginia won six games this past season and went to a bowl game for the first time since 2011. But seasons such as those have become the exception over the last decade, during which time Virginia has endured six years with four wins or fewer. The Cavaliers have had one winning season since 2008 and twice have finished with two victories, including going 2-10 in 2017, a jarring reality check for Mendenhall after he spoke about directing Virginia to a bowl game in his first year in Charlottesville. Among her first goals after meeting with Mendenhall, Williams said, was to raise an additional $500,000 per year for the football budget over the next five years. Following meetings with donors, the figure quickly grew to $1 million because of their belief in Mendenhall's vision to rebuild the program.",

          "Our budget isn't where it needs to be, so all of those things need to change to have a consistently competitive football program.\" Adding a football facility on par with the marquee programs in the ACC remains a top priority, although Williams, the first female African American athletic director at a Power Five school, did not provide specifics regarding a timetable. In June 2017, the Virginia Board of Visitors authorized fundraising and planning for a football operations center at an estimated cost of $55 to $60 million. The building would house all the necessities and amenities to attract top recruits, an area in which the Cavaliers have been lagging behind their ACC counterparts, most notably in-state rival Virginia Tech. The football staff operates largely out of the McCue Center, located across the street from John Paul Jones Arena, the Cavaliers' state-of-the-art home court for men's and women's basketball. But McCue, which opened in 1991, has grown outdated compared to those at the likes of Clemson, Florida State, Virginia Tech, Miami and other conference powers. \"If there is a four- or five-star recruit from the Tidewater area or Norfolk, let's just say, and they've narrowed their choices to Virginia, to Notre Dame, to Stanford, to Michigan and they take visits to those places, they're going to choose the schools that they think are making an investment in their future,\" Williams said. \"Because if you're a four-star recruit, you probably have aspirations of playing the NFL, and your college experience is your opportunity to do that.",

          "CHARLOTTESVILLE - On her first full day as Virginia athletic director five months ago, Carla Williams met with Coach Bronco Mendenhall for roughly two hours to discuss the state of the football program. Having been an athlete and administrator at Georgia, she arrived at her new post keenly aware of the how much football matters not only to the financial profile of a Power Five institution but also the ways in which its success - or, in the Cavaliers' case in recent seasons, a lack thereof - can affect an entire athletic department. So during a nearly one-hour sit-down with members of the media on Friday afternoon, Williams spoke almost exclusively about her efforts to return football to prominence via several avenues, most notably fundraising, facilities and ticket sales. [Blackistone: It's not wrong to say college sports is like slavery. It's wrong that no one's trying to fix that.] \"It didn't take me very long to start to realize that we've got a structural problem in football,\" Williams said. \"We're understaffed in some areas. Obviously we've got some facilities issues in some areas.",

He was a heralded assistant coach at Florida, Georgia Tech and Duke, then a successful head coach in the first spring professional football league, the USFL, where he led the Tampa Bay Bandits. Then, of course, he went back to college, first coaching at Duke and then moving on to Florida, earning a reputation as a reliable, if colorful, character on the sideline. The new league seems to remember all that. What it doesn't appear to remember, though, is when Daniel Snyder came calling in 2002. In Spurrier's otherwise very thorough official bio on the Alliance's website, the league completely neglects his NFL coaching history, all two years of it, which was spent in Washington. Don't worry, we remember, thanks to The Post's Mark Maske and George Solomon: The Washington Redskins made Steve Spurrier one of the highest-paid coaches in the National Football League by signing him to a five-year contract worth slightly less than $25 million. They also allowed him to recapture a part of his youth."

Someone might want to remind the Alliance of American Football. The spring football league set to launch in 2019 announced Orlando as the location of its first team Sunday morning. And with the location, founder Charlie Ebersol announced the new head (ball) coach: Steve Spurrier. It is hard to find many football characters more well-known than Spurrier.

That, plus the lucrative opportunity to coach a team in the nation's capital at 86,000-plus-seat FedEx Field made the decision to take the Redskins' job easy. \"It was the opportunity to coach on the national scene for a team that plays in the largest stadium in the National Football League, that sells all those tickets and with all those fans,\" Spurrier said yesterday by telephone from his home in Gainesville, Fla. \"They're the best fans in the NFL. It's so loud there.\" Washington would wind up burning through three quarterbacks - who could forget Shane Matthews, Patrick Ramsey and Danny Wuerffel? - on the way to a 7-9 record in 2002 and a 5-11 mark in 2003. Then Spurrier resigned, so Maske wrote another story: Coach Steve Spurrier walked away from the Washington Redskins and the National Football League yesterday after two seasons in which he managed just 12 victories in 32 games and extended the team's playoff drought despite being the league's highest-paid coach. Spurrier said he left because he thought team owner Daniel Snyder could find someone else to do far better than he did.",

That appears to have been the case, but so far, he has been more interested in playing basketball than the sport he could have been making millions by playing this season.He also was interested on Wednesday in making something of a defense of his lengthy absence from the Steelers, who placed a $14.55 million franchise tag on Bell this summer after failing to come to an agreement on a long-term contract. With an eye toward getting a lucrative deal from another team in free agency next spring &mdash; as long as he stays healthy &mdash; the three-time Pro Bowler has declined thus far to sign the one-year offer, in the process costing himself over $855,000 each week since the regular season began.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not apologizing for what I believe is right for myself, family and the rest of my peers, period,&rdquo; Bell said in a Twitter post rendered in upside-down text.",

He has until this coming Tuesday, Nov. 13, to sign with the Steelers if he wants to play football at all this season, but there could be significant financial incentives for him not to do so.As Fowler pointed out, the Steelers would be very unlikely to place a third straight franchise tag on Bell after this season, because that would obligate them to pay him more than $20 million, an exorbitant sum for a non-quarterback, for the 2019 campaign. The team would have the option, though, of applying a transition tag, which would mean paying him 120 percent of his previous salary.Because Bell has not been paid anything this season, that salary figure could come from the 2017 season, when he made $12.1 million, so the transition tag would garner him around $14.5 million next year.",
          "However if he signs before Tuesday and ends up playing in, say, six games at full pay, that would mean he earned $5.13 million this year, and 120 percent of that would be roughly $6.2 million.If that&rsquo;s how it plays out, Bell and the players' union would almost certainly contest any attempt by the Steelers to set such a relatively low 2019 salary figure for him, but he might decide to simply avoid that scenario by sitting out the rest of the season. Doing so, though, would cost him a year of NFL service, which would have implications for his pension, health care benefits, 401(k) plan and other financial calculations.There has been speculation that Bell and the Steelers may have already come to an informal understanding, one in which they agree to simply let him walk in free agency without placing any tag on him, if he stays away from the team for the rest of the season. It&rsquo;s possible, if the Steelers have yet to clearly signal that they are willing to go along with this arrangement, that his arrival in Pittsburgh is meant to prod them into doing so.The Steelers would have reason to possibly prefer that Bell stays away, given that the team has attained a solid 5-2-1 record in his absence, with backup running back James Conner making his own Pro Bowl bid.",

          "When Bell did not report before Week 1, he was subjected to unusual criticism from some teammates, and he might prove to be an awkward, if not outright divisive, presence in Pittsburgh&rsquo;s locker room.&ldquo;This Le&rsquo;Veon thing is just a cloud over us at this point,&rdquo; an unidentified Steelers player said Wednesday to NFL Network&rsquo;s Aditi Kinkhabwala. &ldquo;Just make a decision, sign or not, be in or out, and let&rsquo;s all move forward.&rdquo;\"Just about everybody has an opinion on my life and worried about what I&rsquo;m doing &hellip; Don&rsquo;t judge me off my decisions because maybe this isn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d do,&rdquo; Bell said in another of his upside-down Twitter posts. &ldquo;But most people don&rsquo;t take the time to just simply read between the lines &hellip; and that&rsquo;s clearly on them.&rdquo;"

He has until this coming Tuesday, Nov. 13, to sign with the Steelers if he wants to play football at all this season, but there could be significant financial incentives for him not to do so.As Fowler pointed out, the Steelers would be very unlikely to place a third straight franchise tag on Bell after this season, because that would obligate them to pay him more than $20 million, an exorbitant sum for a non-quarterback, for the 2019 campaign. The team would have the option, though, of applying a transition tag, which would mean paying him 120 percent of his previous salary.Because Bell has not been paid anything this season, that salary figure could come from the 2017 season, when he made $12.1 million, so the transition tag would garner him around $14.5 million next year.",

Linda was the definition of a loving, devoted spouse.&rdquo;Zimmerman was forced to abandon his writing career in 2008, after a series of strokes left him physically impaired and in a wheelchair.",
          "According to King, Zimmerman and his wife moved in October to an assisted living facility in Indiana, close to her family, where he died Thursday.After graduating from Columbia Journalism School, Zimmerman latched on with the Sacramento Bee and covered a variety of sports there for several years before returning to New York in 1960 (per a memoir republished in 2016). He moved six years later from the World Telegram to the New York Post, where he began an 11-year stint as a Jets beat writer before being hired by SI in 1979.Over three decades at the magazine, Zimmerman was able to draw on his firsthand knowledge of how the modern NFL had evolved while also proving adept at taking advantage of how the Internet provided a new platform for his extended musings. Of his time as Zimmerman&rsquo;s editor at SI&rsquo;s website, Jimmy Traina wrote on Thursday, &ldquo;Not only was I treated to reading and editing his tremendous writing each week, but I was also able to work with a man in his 70s who understood the Internet better than any other writer.&ldquo;He was so ahead of his time with how he wrote for an online audience.",
          "His mailbag was unlike any other mailbag there is or ever will be,&rdquo; Traina continued. &ldquo;His columns gave you an inside look at the technical aspect of football &mdash; he loved critiquing line play &mdash; but he wrote in a way the common fan could understand.&rdquo;Through it all, Zimmerman&rsquo;s writing style contributed to a gruff, even cantankerous old-school persona, but that was belied by the affection he inspired among those who knew him.&ldquo;The Zim I was lucky enough to get to know was every bit as extraordinary in real life as the man who covered football like no other, before, during or since,&rdquo; Michael Silver, a former SI colleague now with NFL.com, wrote Thursday. &ldquo;He was gutsy, gritty and bawdy, teeming with over-the-top quirks and propelled by a ruthless work ethic that was counterbalanced by humor and an indefatigable zest for adventure.&rdquo;"

Peter King, a longtime former colleague at SI who now works for NBC Sports, broke the news Thursday, saying, &ldquo;We have lost a legend.&rdquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one Dr. Z,&rdquo; King added, using a nickname for Zimmerman that the latter himself adopted for his columns. &ldquo;He had more influence on the business than anyone I know.&rdquo;An offensive lineman in his playing days, Zimmerman&rsquo;s understanding of that position was among the many insights that his readers would have had difficulty finding elsewhere. His analytical approach, in which he charted games and broke down the performances of individual players, stood out from conventional, narrative-driven NFL coverage and presaged the way many fans consume football today.Zimmerman wrote several books on the NFL, two of which are considered among the most important ever published in the genre: 1970&prime;s &ldquo;A Thinking Man&rsquo;s Guide to Pro Football&rdquo; and its 1984 sequel, &ldquo;New Thinking Man&rsquo;s Guide to Pro Football.&rdquo; He also brought a personal touch that endeared him to fans, adding tidbits to his columns for SI about his love of wine and for &ldquo;the Flaming Redhead,&rdquo; his wife Linda.&ldquo;We all should have a partner in life like Paul had in Linda, his wife of 19 years,&rdquo; King said on Twitter.",

          "Tom Benson, shown with wife Gayle, was a familiar figure at Saints games. (Dave Martin/AP) Tom Benson, a towering figure in New Orleans who owned the NFL's Saints and the NBA's Pelicans, died Thursday at the age of 90. His widow, Gayle Benson, assumed control of both teams, although some members of Benson's family may try again to contest that. Benson had been admitted to a New Orleans-area hospital with flulike symptoms in February, and according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, after being moved to the intensive care unit, he remained there until he died. He bought the Saints in 1985 to keep the team in place and help it anchor his beloved but struggling city, and he went on to purchase the Pelicans, then called the Hornets, in 2012. Having married his third wife, Gayle Benson, in 2004, Benson revealed considerable tension in the family when he made a surprising announcement in 2015 that he would be ending a planned succession of his teams and other holdings to his daughter Renee Benson and his two grandchildren through her, Rita and Ryan LeBlanc. Instead, he designated Gayle Benson as that heir, setting off a bitter dispute in which his daughter and grandchildren went to court to contend that Benson had become mentally unfit to manage his own affairs. Benson was declared competent in court, but there was more legal wrangling over nonvoting shares of the teams that were held in trusts for the LeBlancs. A settlement on those shares was reached last year, and while terms were not disclosed, Gayle Benson was publicly confirmed Thursday as the owner of the Saints and Pelicans.",

In that, he echoed other athletes who have come forward in recent years with their own stories about depression. Chargers tackle Joe Barksdale explained to the Los Angeles Times, \"Some days you can talk yourself out of it. Some days you can't. Some days it just feels impossible.\" Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps has said that, at times, he \"straight up wanted to die.\" The NBA's Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan shared their stories, too, while wide receiver Brandon Marshall - one of the first athletes to openly advocate for mental health awareness - has called that \"the civil rights issue of our era.\"",

          "Steve Smith Sr., shown in 2014, is learning how to deal with depression. (Evan Habeeb/USA Today) Over 16 seasons in the NFL, Steve Smith Sr. developed a reputation for being one of the toughest wide receivers in the game. But he never really appreciated the accolades and stats he piled up, he says now, because he was struggling with depression throughout his playing career. \"Despite all of my achievements, I routinely felt trapped, inferior and alone,\" Smith wrote this week in a first-person column on NFL.com. \"This overwhelmed me internally and often left me mentally, physically and emotionally broken.\" Such struggles among pro athletes have become a regular media topic in recent days; last weekend, for example, former Philadelphia Eagles great Brian Dawkins said in his Hall of Fame induction speech that his deepest days of depression led him to consider methods of suicide that would allow his family to collect on his life insurance. For Smith, the 1,031 career catches for 14,731 yards (eighth all-time) and 81 touchdowns with the Carolina Panthers and Baltimore Ravens didn't really register, he wrote in the column, because of his internal battles. \"I never truly enjoyed those moments,\" he wrote, \"never felt genuine delight in my accomplishments.\" His playing persona seemed invulnerable, impossibly strong and feisty, willing to take on all defenders.",

          "As the drama of Le&rsquo;Veon Bell&rsquo;s contract staredown has played out around them, the outcome of that subplot has become increasingly irrelevant to the Pittsburgh Steelers&rsquo; season.The Steelers have James Conner to thank for that.Conner, the second-year running back who has replaced Bell while the two-time Pro Bowl selection has been absent from the team all season while refusing to sign the franchise-player deal, has become one of the NFL&rsquo;s best success stories, adding football exploits to his more important real-life success story of being a cancer survivor.And while the Bell saga continues to play out in advance of next Tuesday&rsquo;s deadline to join the Steelers if he wants to be eligible to play this season, it will be Conner who will be carrying the ball Thursday night for the Steelers when they host the Carolina Panthers in a compelling game between two playoff contenders.The Steelers have won four straight games to improve to 5-2-1. That upswing has coincided with Conner&rsquo;s emergence as a standout NFL runner. He&rsquo;s had four straight 100-yard rushing games, giving him five such performances this season. And he shows no signs of tiring under what has become a heavy workload.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m built for it,&rdquo; Conner said after running for 107 yards and catching a touchdown pass in this past Sunday&rsquo;s triumph at Baltimore.Conner is on pace to run for 1,412 yards and 18 touchdowns this season. He&rsquo;s on course to add 76 catches for 758 yards and two touchdowns.Bell has been one of the NFL&rsquo;s most productive running backs throughout his five-year Steelers tenure. But he&rsquo;s never had a 1,400-yard rushing season, he&rsquo;s never had more than nine rushing touchdowns in a season, and he has reached 700 receiving yards in a season only once.Conner is doing all of that for a salary of $578,000 this season under the terms of his four-year rookie deal.Bell was to make $14.544 million after being franchise-tagged by the Steelers. He has refused to sign that one-year contract after he and the Steelers were unable to agree to a long-term deal to Bell&rsquo;s liking.He must sign his contract and join the team by Tuesday to be eligible to play this season. The NFL&rsquo;s trade deadline already has passed.",

But then he paused and said something that hasn't been suggested often about teams here in recent years. \"I think we have a bunch of guys who are all in,\" he said. This is no small matter because football teams are fragile things, no matter how large the men who play the game. Personal interests get in the way. Some players lose motivation; some never have it. Dedication is a hard concept when most predictions say your team is destined to finish last in its division. These Redskins are not much like other Washington teams of the past. The locker room is not packed with big names who have had flashy careers. A word rarely used around the current group is drama. And when have you been able to say that about a Redskins team?",

But I think we have a bunch of guys who are all in, who are invested in what we are doing here, and I think that's all you can ask for. It's a tough team that's not afraid of competition, and they toe the line. That's apparent through camp up until this point.\" After 13 seasons in San Francisco and Kansas City, Smith has been around enough players and teams to understand which ones believe and which do not. As Washington tight end Vernon Davis, who was Smith's teammate years ago with the 49ers, said Sunday: \"Thirteen years, you see all those things.\" Then Davis went even further than Smith in his observation of this team. \"All the guys in here are great athletes, but this team has everything you are looking for from a group,\" Davis said. \"Nobody in here is about himself.

          "Alex Smith stood behind the Washington Redskins' weight room Sunday afternoon, contemplating the psyche of a team he has known for only a handful of months. At first, the Redskins quarterback sounded vague about his new teammates, suggesting that you can never know the heart of a football player until the season begins, things go wrong and his desire is tested.

Don&rsquo;t want to, but that&rsquo;s just how the game goes for you, and you just have to play within that game.&rdquo;The Giants are 1-6, but their offense still has serious playmaking ability. Beckham and rookie Saquon Barkley are one of the best wide receiver-running back tandems in the NFL. Barkley is fourth in the league with 481 rushing yards and tied for fifth with five rushing touchdowns. His seven rushes of 20-plus yards are a league high, and his three runs of 40-plus yards are tied for the NFL best.&ldquo;I think the teams that he had those runs against, they had their eye out on him,\" Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said. \"It&rsquo;s just hard.

He runs you over. He stiff-arms you, and then all hell breaks loose. So we have to do a great job of wrapping him up, hold him up and then, like I said, always you have to pursue to the football.&rdquo;Beckham&rsquo;s 649 receiving yards rank fourth in the league, but his two touchdowns through seven games put him on pace for a career low in a full season.The Redskins have shined against the run, slowing David Johnson, Alvin Kamara, Christian McCaffery and Ezekiel Elliott to rank third in the NFL at 87.3 rushing yards against per game. But the combination of Barkley and Beckham makes Sunday&rsquo;s matchup a little different.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the defensive coordinator&rsquo;s problem and nightmare,\" Gruden said with a laugh. \"It&rsquo;s good that our front is doing a very good job against the run without having to bring a lot of safeties in a lot of times, but Saquon is a different guy. He&rsquo;s a combination of Kamara, who can catch it out of the backfield, and the quickness of Zeke Elliott, who&rsquo;s got the power and the speed."

[Adrian Peterson to work out for the Redskins] \"I don't think that's the case everywhere,\" Smith added. \"I think for a lot of guys it's easy not to invest because it's scary - scary to put yourself out there knowing you might not succeed. But I think we have a bunch of guys who are all in, who are invested in what we are doing here, and I think that's all you can ask for. It's a tough team that's not afraid of competition, and they toe the line. That's apparent through camp up until this point.\" After 13 seasons in San Francisco and Kansas City, Smith has been around enough players and teams to understand which ones believe and which do not. As Washington tight end Vernon Davis, who was Smith's teammate years ago with the 49ers, said Sunday: \"Thirteen years, you see all those things.\" Then Davis went even further than Smith in his observation of this team. \"All the guys in here are great athletes, but this team has everything you are looking for from a group,\" Davis said. \"Nobody in here is about himself. I can't go around this room and say: 'This guy is egotistic.'",

At first, the Redskins quarterback sounded vague about his new teammates, suggesting that you can never know the heart of a football player until the season begins, things go wrong and his desire is tested. But then he paused and said something that hasn't been suggested often about teams here in recent years. \"I think we have a bunch of guys who are all in,\" he said.

          "I think that quickly becomes apparent when you put all those things together. \"You can see what guys are really made of, who's faking it. And I think we have a bunch of guys who are all in.\" Of course, things can change. Washington is already looking at adding established running backs such as Jamaal Charles, who visited Sunday, or Adrian Peterson, who will meet with team officials Monday. A star can make a difference on the field but also can change the chemistry of a locker room for better or for worse. \"You don't know what you are made of [as a team] until you get put into situations where the intensity gets turned up, the pressure gets turned up, you're facing tough times,\" Smith said. \"How are you going to handle it? How are you going to respond when adversity comes?\" For now, though, he looks around a new locker room, filled with new faces, and he gets a feeling he hasn't always had from a team.

          "Alex Smith stood behind the Washington Redskins' weight room Sunday afternoon, contemplating the psyche of a team he has known for only a handful of months. At first, the Redskins quarterback sounded vague about his new teammates, suggesting that you can never know the heart of a football player until the season begins, things go wrong and his desire is tested. But then he paused and said something that hasn't been suggested often about teams here in recent years. \"I think we have a bunch of guys who are all in,\" he said. This is no small matter because football teams are fragile things, no matter how large the men who play the game. Personal interests get in the way. Some players lose motivation; some never have it. Dedication is a hard concept when most predictions say your team is destined to finish last in its division. These Redskins are not much like other Washington teams of the past. The locker room is not packed with big names who have had flashy careers. A word rarely used around the current group is drama. And when have you been able to say that about a Redskins team?",

          "As the drama of Le&rsquo;Veon Bell&rsquo;s contract staredown has played out around them, the outcome of that subplot has become increasingly irrelevant to the Pittsburgh Steelers&rsquo; season.The Steelers have James Conner to thank for that.Conner, the second-year running back who has replaced Bell while the two-time Pro Bowl selection has been absent from the team all season while refusing to sign the franchise-player deal, has become one of the NFL&rsquo;s best success stories, adding football exploits to his more important real-life success story of being a cancer survivor.And while the Bell saga continues to play out in advance of next Tuesday&rsquo;s deadline to join the Steelers if he wants to be eligible to play this season, it will be Conner who will be carrying the ball Thursday night for the Steelers when they host the Carolina Panthers in a compelling game between two playoff contenders.The Steelers have won four straight games to improve to 5-2-1. That upswing has coincided with Conner&rsquo;s emergence as a standout NFL runner. He&rsquo;s had four straight 100-yard rushing games, giving him five such performances this season. And he shows no signs of tiring under what has become a heavy workload.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m built for it,&rdquo; Conner said after running for 107 yards and catching a touchdown pass in this past Sunday&rsquo;s triumph at Baltimore.Conner is on pace to run for 1,412 yards and 18 touchdowns this season. He&rsquo;s on course to add 76 catches for 758 yards and two touchdowns.Bell has been one of the NFL&rsquo;s most productive running backs throughout his five-year Steelers tenure. But he&rsquo;s never had a 1,400-yard rushing season, he&rsquo;s never had more than nine rushing touchdowns in a season, and he has reached 700 receiving yards in a season only once.Conner is doing all of that for a salary of $578,000 this season under the terms of his four-year rookie deal.Bell was to make $14.544 million after being franchise-tagged by the Steelers. He has refused to sign that one-year contract after he and the Steelers were unable to agree to a long-term deal to Bell&rsquo;s liking.He must sign his contract and join the team by Tuesday to be eligible to play this season. The NFL&rsquo;s trade deadline already has passed.",

But the combination of Barkley and Beckham makes Sunday&rsquo;s matchup a little different.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the defensive coordinator&rsquo;s problem and nightmare,\" Gruden said with a laugh. \"It&rsquo;s good that our front is doing a very good job against the run without having to bring a lot of safeties in a lot of times, but Saquon is a different guy.

It was awesome. \"Perhaps no one appreciated Totolo&rsquo;s stealthy move more than Cooley himself, who witnessed it live and mentioned it on his &ldquo;Cooley at the Park&rdquo; podcast on Monday.&ldquo;Two guys in Tampa jerseys come out,&rdquo; Cooley explained to his guest, Redskins president of business operations Brian Lafemina. &ldquo;The guy who wins it finishes it off, and as soon as he wins it, rips his Tampa Bay jersey off and he&rsquo;s got a Cooley jersey on, and he starts spoon feeding himself. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!",

You want to come to D.C.? I&rsquo;ll hook you up with tickets and field passes, guy, whoever you are. That was incredible. I wasn&rsquo;t paying much attention, and then afterwards, I saw this guy dancing in a Cooley jersey, and I was like, &lsquo;How did I not notice this guy come out on the field in my jersey?&rsquo; How amazing is that?&rdquo; As it turns out, Totolo listens to Cooley&rsquo;s podcast all the time.",
          "He said he hadn&rsquo;t yet had a chance to listen to Monday&rsquo;s episode when he received a text message from a friend on Tuesday morning asking Totolo to call him. It was urgent. Totolo muted the teleconference he was on and called his friend, who just couldn&rsquo;t wait to let him know that Cooley had mentioned him on his podcast.&ldquo;At my age, Cooley was like a childhood hero,&rdquo; Totolo, 30, said. &ldquo;He was the guy. Him and Sean Taylor. So for him to mention me on the pod, I was like, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re kidding me, right?&rsquo;&rdquo;Totolo, who asked a Redskins fan sitting in his section to record the contest and ensuing celebration, tweeted the video at Cooley on Wednesday morning.&ldquo;This is all time awesome man,&rdquo; Cooley replied. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Totolo and his dad were already planning to attend the Redskins' game at Jacksonville in December. Now there&rsquo;s a trip to FedEx Field, including field passes compliments of Chris Cooley, in their future."

          "Ryan Totolo, a die-hard Redskins fan living in Orlando, attended Sunday&rsquo;s game in Tampa Bay with his dad, Chris. Before kickoff at Raymond James Stadium, Totolo entered a raffle to win a Publix gift card. He didn&rsquo;t think much of it until he received a call informing him that he had been chosen to participate in Publix&rsquo;s on-field football toss promotion during the second quarter.When Totolo reported to the designated staging area decked out in Redskins shoes, burgundy and gold striped socks, Redskins shorts and a Chris Cooley Redskins jersey, the woman organizing the promotion was concerned.&ldquo;I wanted to throw the footballs, so I said, &lsquo;Give me a Bucs T-shirt or something, we&rsquo;ll work it out,'\" Totolo said in a phone interview on Wednesday. Totolo assured the woman that he was &ldquo;a big Bucs guy,&rdquo; and she agreed to let him participate, provided he wear a Publix-branded Buccaneers jersey.&ldquo;All the while I&rsquo;m thinking to myself, &lsquo;If I win this, this jersey&rsquo;s coming off,&rsquo;&rdquo; Totolo said.Totolo won. The Buccaneers jersey came off, revealing Chris Cooley&rsquo;s familiar No. 47. Captain Fear, the Buccaneers' mascot, pretended to stab Totolo with his sword as the victorious impostor danced around the 10-yard line in his Captain Chaos jersey. Totolo high-stepped his way to the end zone pylon and offered his take on Redskins safety D.J. Swearinger&rsquo;s &ldquo;two spoons&rdquo; celebration.&ldquo;The lady was not happy,&rdquo; said Totolo, who was greeted with loud cheers when he returned to his seat.",

          "Ryan Totolo, a die-hard Redskins fan living in Orlando, attended Sunday&rsquo;s game in Tampa Bay with his dad, Chris. Before kickoff at Raymond James Stadium, Totolo entered a raffle to win a Publix gift card. He didn&rsquo;t think much of it until he received a call informing him that he had been chosen to participate in Publix&rsquo;s on-field football toss promotion during the second quarter.When Totolo reported to the designated staging area decked out in Redskins shoes, burgundy and gold striped socks, Redskins shorts and a Chris Cooley Redskins jersey, the woman organizing the promotion was concerned.&ldquo;I wanted to throw the footballs, so I said, &lsquo;Give me a Bucs T-shirt or something, we&rsquo;ll work it out,'\" Totolo said in a phone interview on Wednesday. Totolo assured the woman that he was &ldquo;a big Bucs guy,&rdquo; and she agreed to let him participate, provided he wear a Publix-branded Buccaneers jersey.&ldquo;All the while I&rsquo;m thinking to myself, &lsquo;If I win this, this jersey&rsquo;s coming off,&rsquo;&rdquo; Totolo said.Totolo won. The Buccaneers jersey came off, revealing Chris Cooley&rsquo;s familiar No. 47. Captain Fear, the Buccaneers' mascot, pretended to stab Totolo with his sword as the victorious impostor danced around the 10-yard line in his Captain Chaos jersey. Totolo high-stepped his way to the end zone pylon and offered his take on Redskins safety D.J. Swearinger&rsquo;s &ldquo;two spoons&rdquo; celebration.&ldquo;The lady was not happy,&rdquo; said Totolo, who was greeted with loud cheers when he returned to his seat.",

          "Ohio State President Michael Drake and Urban Meyer at Wednesday night's news conference. (Paul Vernon/Associated Press) Ohio State's decision to suspend Urban Meyer for three games over his handling of domestic violence allegations about a former assistant disgusted plenty of college football observers. For many, the punishment was deemed insufficient, the coach's subsequent statements misguided and oblivious. The Meyer incident was enough to drive ESPN's Michelle Beadle to publicly swear that she will not watch football this fall, although her network makes a large chunk of its revenue from the college and NFL games and she must discuss both as a co-host of the \"Get Up\" morning show. \"There's a reason why this will be the second season I don't watch NFL and I don't spend my Saturdays watching college football either,\" Beadle said Thursday. \"I believe that the sport of football has set itself up to be in a position where it shows itself in the bigger picture to not really care about women - they don't really care about people of color, but we won't get into that for [the] NFL either. But as a woman, I feel like a person who has been marginalized.\" It's hard to blame her. The NFL mishandled the domestic violence crisis that stemmed from the Ray Rice incident in 2014.

The investigation determined that when Meyer learned that Zach Smith's ex-wife, Courtney, was publicly accusing him of ignoring her claims of domestic violence, one of the first things the head coach did was discuss with an assistant how to delete old text messages from his phone, so reporters couldn't see them. When the university took the phone, it had been set to save text messages only for the previous year. A public records request from Ohio State's student newspaper for messages Meyer sent during crucial months in 2015, the report suggested, will likely never get filled as a result. Me, pretending to be surprised at each story out of the ol' football world. - Michelle Beadle (@MichelleDBeadle) August 23, 2018 Beadle pointed out that Meyer was misleading about how he handled the situation, and had a long day in which to \"pretend to say he was sorry\" and to apologize to the ex-wife of his former assistant. He did not apologize to her. \"And every single one of these stories that comes out, every single time, pushes me further and further away\" from football, Beadle said. \"I realize they don't care, but for me it's opened up my weekends. I appreciate you for giving that to me. I don't care anymore. I've lost the ability to be surprised."

          "The NFL conceded two years ago a connection between football and CTE. A growing medical consensus suggests a connection between repeated blows to the head and CTE, which has symptoms that include memory difficulty, mood changes, depression, impaired judgment and dementia. USA Today columnist Dan Wolken demanded Fedora's termination \"if he can't acknowledge dangers of CTE.\" Chris Nowinski, chief executive of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, a former Harvard defensive tackle and a doctor of behavioral neuroscience, told The Washington Post that Fedora's comments were \"a dangerous place to be.\" ESPN college football analyst Paul Finebaum told Fedora on \"Outside the Lines\" to \"go to the library and read\" about CTE and questioned \"how this great university can stand behind someone who made those comments.\" \"I've known Larry Fedora to be an unusually bright guy, but he came off utterly stupid here...\" - @finebaum  - Outside The Lines (@OTLonESPN) July 19, 2018 But Fedora has his backers, among them Fox NFL analyst Mark Schlereth and columnist Jason Whitlock, former NFL quarterback Trent Dilfer and Yahoo Sports columnist Eric Adelson. Schlereth, speaking on Fox's \"Speak for Yourself\" program, called Fedora's comments \"salient\" and cast doubt on CTE's role in the deteriorating health of some current and former football players. \"Certainly I believe that repeated concussions or repeated head trauma will probably create a situation where you have some injury, some CTE,\" Schlereth said.",

At least, my opinion.\" Whitlock later in the program said, \"I think the CTE thing is exaggerated.\" They appeared to be referring to Fedora's statement that any sport that involves head impact includes concussion risk. \"I'm not sure that anything has proven that football itself causes it,\" Fedora told reporters later Wednesday. \"Now we do know from what my understanding is that repeated blows to the head do cause it, so every sport that you have, football included, could be a problem with that, right? As long as you've got any kind of contact, you could have that.\"",

Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world."

[Bonded by blown Super Bowl, Falcons a serious threat after beating Rams] Bortles's counterpart, Tyrod Taylor, didn't fare much better. In what many believe was his final appearance in a Bills uniform, Taylor (32.1 QB rating) woefully underperformed and eventually was forced to leave the game with 1:17 left after a hard hit from Dante Fowler Jr. caused his head to hit the turf. \"We had a good job of calling stunt, so I think that's what gave him pause,\" Fowler said. \"I was actually on the ground when I had done my stunt or whatever, and I managed to get back up and was able to ride him and literally tried to slam him. I hope he's okay. I was just glad to be able to make a play for my team.\" Taylor's replacement, Nathan Peterman - the rookie quarterback who, after he was surprisingly named the starter over Taylor against the Los Angeles Chargers, threw five interceptions in his one and only starting appearance this season - picked up where he left off in Week 11. Literally. Peterman completed a 14-yard pass, then followed it with an interception caught by Jalen Ramsey with 26 seconds left to seal the Jaguars' victory. With their six-time Pro Bowl running back LeSean McCoy (19 carries, 75 yards) significantly hampered by a badly sprained ankle, the Bills' offense rested solely in the hands of Taylor.",

          "Brett Favre speaks at his 2016 NFL Hall of Fame enshrinement ceremony. (Charles LeClaire/USA Today Sports) According to the New York Post Tuesday, Brett Favre flunked an audition to replace Jon Gruden on \"Monday Night Football.\" According to Favre, he merely had a \"good meeting\" with producers of the telecast which resulted in him expressing ambivalence about possibly pursuing a career in the TV booth. The Post's Andrew Marchand, who has broken several bits of news on efforts to fill out the lineups for both ESPN's \"MNF\" and Fox Sports's inaugural telecasts of \"Thursday Night Football,\" offered the report on Favre. Citing sources, Marchand claimed that the former Packers quarterback \"was not great during the tryout\" and was informed that \"he is no longer under consideration.\" Several hours later, Favre took to Twitter to present his version of events.",

          "Colt McCoy signed a one-year contract extension Thursday that could be worth up to $7 million. (Steve Helber/AP) RICHMOND - Practice has ended, autographs have been signed, and Colt McCoy is sopping with sweat. The mud squishes beneath his cleats as he trudges past the end zone at one corner of the practice field and makes his way up the grassy incline toward the cold tubs. His love of the game is what keeps him playing. The grind is what keeps him going. But it's his bond with Coach Jay Gruden, the stability of the offensive system, and his affection for the D.C. area that keep McCoy happily tethered to the Washington Redskins. There is no place this No. 2 quarterback would rather be on these sweltering, sticky summer days, and for that reason, he didn't hesitate to sign a one-year extension worth up to $7 million this week. [Redskins sign backup QB Colt McCoy to one-year extension] \"If I'm going to play in the NFL, there's nowhere I want to play right now other than the Redskins,\" McCoy said. \"I know how this team feels about me, so I just try to block out the other noise and be the best I can be. There's a lot of guys who have played a lot of football after their ninth year.\" \"At this point,\" he added of his extension, \"it was good enough.\" His contract, which was set to expire after the 2018 season, contained a clause that would have allowed him to become a free agent if he played 65 percent of the team's offensive snaps.",

(Steve Helber/AP) RICHMOND - Practice has ended, autographs have been signed, and Colt McCoy is sopping with sweat. The mud squishes beneath his cleats as he trudges past the end zone at one corner of the practice field and makes his way up the grassy incline toward the cold tubs. His love of the game is what keeps him playing. The grind is what keeps him going. But it's his bond with Coach Jay Gruden, the stability of the offensive system, and his affection for the D.C. area that keep McCoy happily tethered to the Washington Redskins. There is no place this No. 2 quarterback would rather be on these sweltering, sticky summer days, and for that reason, he didn't hesitate to sign a one-year extension worth up to $7 million this week. [Redskins sign backup QB Colt McCoy to one-year extension] \"If I'm going to play in the NFL, there's nowhere I want to play right now other than the Redskins,\" McCoy said. \"I know how this team feels about me, so I just try to block out the other noise and be the best I can be. There's a lot of guys who have played a lot of football after their ninth year.\" \"At this point,\" he added of his extension, \"it was good enough.\" His contract, which was set to expire after the 2018 season, contained a clause that would have allowed him to become a free agent if he played 65 percent of the team's offensive snaps.",

But I'll be the best I can be in this role for now,\" McCoy said, stressing how much he respects Smith, whom he called \"fun to work with\" and \"a true professional.\" \"If I didn't want to compete or play, I would just hang it up. I've played a long time, got a great family, but this allows me to be here, to be a part of something special. My wife and I love D.C., we love our community, and we try to be involved there.

He went 1-3 as a starter in 2014, throwing for 1,507 yards and four touchdowns in place of Cousins before being benched after Griffin returned from injury. Over the next three seasons, McCoy made only two appearances with no starts. But there's a calmness that comes with knowing how much the organization values him, he said. Especially Gruden. \"Jay brought me, he taught me the system,\" McCoy said, before referencing Gruden's vocal support. \"I work as hard as I can work and I think he appreciates a guy that can just be the same person every day.

          "\"It's about getting this football team better. And it wasn't good enough tonight.\" The outcome was no surprise. The Rams reached the playoffs last season as their first-year coach, Sean McVay, transformed Jared Goff into a franchise quarterback and helped tailback Todd Gurley to be a league MVP candidate. The Rams upped the stakes this past offseason by adding wide receiver Brandin Cooks, defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh and cornerbacks Marcus Peters and Aqib Talib. They are in Super Bowl-or-bust mode. And after a sluggish start Monday, understandable after McVay kept his offensive stars under wraps during the preseason, the Rams gradually asserted themselves as the game progressed and took complete control late. They outscored the Raiders, 23-0, in the second half. The Raiders led, 13-10, at halftime and were tied at 13 until the final moments of the third quarter. \"The crowd was in it,\" Gruden said afterward of his team's early success. \"It was electrifying. Unfortunately we could not bottle it and sustain it.\" The way in which the Raiders lost was troubling. Carr made puzzling mistakes, throwing one interception on an up-for-grabs pass and another that was returned for a touchdown by Peters.",
          "The Raiders sacked Goff only once, on a play during which Bruce Irvin forced a fumble. Other than that, the Oakland defense could put almost no pressure on Goff. The absence of Mack, the former NFL defensive player of the year, was glaring. In the first half Sunday night, Mack had a sack, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery, an interception and a touchdown on defense. He and the Bears could not sustain that, and they succumbed to the second-half exploits of Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. But Mack reinforced what a game-changing, difference-making player he is. He left little doubt that he is worth the six-year, $141 million contract given to him by the Bears, making him the league's highest-paid defensive player. [The NFL teams that have serious reasons to worry, versus the ones that don't] Mack, while still with the Raiders, had been holding out, seeking such a deal. The Raiders didn't want to give it to him. They have a $125 million quarterback in Carr. They have a $100 million coach in Gruden. They drew the line at handing out another mammoth deal, not wanting to further strain their budget or push the boundaries of the salary cap. They regarded the king's ransom of draft picks put forth by the Bears, including a pair of first-rounders, as an offer they couldn't refuse. In truth, they could have refused it.",
          "They could have kept Mack and waited until he showed up. Or they could have given him a huge contract. They had an operating profit of $41 million last season, according to Forbes. That's modest by NFL standards, but nevertheless considerable. Their financial situation will improve once they relocate to Las Vegas. The salary cap grows annually, and contracts such as Carr's and Mack's won't seem as daunting in a couple years. The Raiders can try to justify the trade by maintaining that they couldn't afford to pay both Mack and Carr. They can envision using the first-rounders that they'll receive from the Bears to attempt to bolster their roster by the time they move to Vegas. But they'll have to cash in on those draft choices. They'll have to try to find a pass rusher who can change a game like Mack can. In the meantime, Gruden must attempt to win with a roster that is old and lacking. The early returns Monday were not particularly promising. Things might not get better in the foreseeable future. And every time that Mack plays well for the Bears, the Raiders' decision to trade him looks that much worse."

          "Jon Gruden answers questions after his team's loss tot he Jets. (Ben Margot/Associated Press) The trademark \"Chucky\" grimace was on display for a national TV audience on \"Monday Night Football,\" late-night style. The home crowd in Oakland was energized. The Raiders actually were competitive for much of the night against the powerful Los Angeles Rams as Jon Gruden made his highly anticipated return to the sideline in the first regular season game of his second go-round as an NFL head coach. What was missing? Or, more accurately, who was missing? That would be the Raiders' best player, sent on his way when the team ended its contract stare-down with Khalil Mack by trading the standout pass rusher to the Chicago Bears. About 24 hours after Mack made an eye-catching debut for the Bears with a first half as dominant as they come Sunday night in Green Bay, the Raiders lost to the Rams in the second game of ESPN's Monday night doubleheader. Oakland's pass rush was practically nonexistent. Quarterback Derek Carr threw three interceptions and the Raiders came undone late and fell, 33-13. [Sam Darnold's first NFL play was pathetic. After that, he and the Jets were fantastic] The nostalgia about Gruden's return gave way to the harsh reality of the Raiders' current predicament. Gruden acknowledged that at his postgame news conference. \"It's not time for that any more,\" he said.",

          "The Raiders sacked Goff only once, on a play during which Bruce Irvin forced a fumble. Other than that, the Oakland defense could put almost no pressure on Goff. The absence of Mack, the former NFL defensive player of the year, was glaring. In the first half Sunday night, Mack had a sack, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery, an interception and a touchdown on defense. He and the Bears could not sustain that, and they succumbed to the second-half exploits of Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. But Mack reinforced what a game-changing, difference-making player he is. He left little doubt that he is worth the six-year, $141 million contract given to him by the Bears, making him the league's highest-paid defensive player. [The NFL teams that have serious reasons to worry, versus the ones that don't] Mack, while still with the Raiders, had been holding out, seeking such a deal. The Raiders didn't want to give it to him. They have a $125 million quarterback in Carr. They have a $100 million coach in Gruden. They drew the line at handing out another mammoth deal, not wanting to further strain their budget or push the boundaries of the salary cap. They regarded the king's ransom of draft picks put forth by the Bears, including a pair of first-rounders, as an offer they couldn't refuse. In truth, they could have refused it.",

The Rams are not an elite run defense, and it&rsquo;s unlikely their sack totals will impress (just four in three games so far) &mdash; but if you fall behind against this team, it is nearly impossible to catch up.The reason for this goes back to how they&rsquo;re built. The Rams possess two top-level pass-rushing defensive tackles, starting with Aaron Donald, who is the NFL&rsquo;s best. L.A. paired him this year with Ndamukong Suh, one of the most dominant interior linemen of the past decade.They also possess a starting back-four in their secondary that&rsquo;s as good as any in the NFL. Based off 2017 Pro Football Focus grades, cornerback Marcus Peters&rsquo;s 80.7 (on a 0 to 100 scale) was the lowest of the group. Peters and fellow cornerback Aqib Talib suffered injuries in Sunday&rsquo;s win over the Chargers, but both will be back this season and their performance through three games has already solidified this team as the Super Bowl favorite.Teams simply cannot find holes down the field consistently against this group."

Richardson's addition suggested wide receivers Terrelle Pryor Sr. and Ryan Grant, both free agents, won't return. And Tuesday night, Grant and the Baltimore Ravens agreed to a four-year deal worth $29 million, with $13 million guaranteed, a $10 million signing bonus and $3 million in incentives. Grant played the past four seasons with the Redskins after being selected out of Tulane in the fifth round of the 2014 draft. He was Washington's third-leading receiver last year, managing 573 yards. Pryor was one of Washington's marquee offseason additions in 2017, coming off a 77-catch, 1,007-yard season with the Cleveland Browns. But injuries and dropped balls plagued Pryor, who recorded just 240 receiving yards in nine games. He was placed on injured reserve in late November with an ankle injury. Completing a deal with Rodgers-Cromartie would help offset the departures of Breeland and Kendall Fuller, who was part of the trade to bring Smith from Kansas City. Rodgers-Cromartie was released by the New York Giants on Sunday.",
