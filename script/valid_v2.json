{"text": "Adrian Peterson had 11 carries for 56 yards against the Broncos. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) Experience has told Adrian Peterson his body should have ached Saturday morning. The days after games have never been great for the Washington Redskins' new running back, especially for a player who has made a career thundering through lines, all but looking for contact. But after playing his first game in nine months Friday night, Peterson said he was surprised that his body didn't throb more. Other than some soreness in his neck, he actually felt good. \"I could have had another 15 carries,\" he said. The 11 rushes he had for 56 yards in Friday's loss to the Denver Broncos have become the story of the preseason for Washington. Few could have expected the 33-year-old, onetime MVP, who went unsigned through the summer, to look like the player he was in his prime. Not with the injuries that damaged his past two seasons. After watching the tape of Peterson's performance, Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said he noted his new back's vision, patience and acceleration. Adrian Peterson feels strong after Redskins debut: \u2018I could have had another 15 carries.\u2019 But the thing he liked most was the way Peterson clutched the ball tight against his body. \"Ball security is big for us,\" Gruden said. Peterson actually enjoyed watching the film, as well, something he didn't think he would after the game, believing he hadn't run as well as he wanted. He changed his mind Saturday when he noticed small mistakes that easily could be corrected. \"If I was a little more patient on the stretch play, then I could have gotten underneath, or maybe if the receiver had stayed on the block longer, then it would have been a 50-yard run instead of a 13-yard run,\" he said, adding that he stressed to several players the importance of staying with plays until their end. \"So it's good to get those mistakes out of the way and clean it up.\" Gruden said Sunday that he wants to see Peterson in more situations than straight runs, to see how he moves on pitches and even a few passing routes. Peterson, who said he has been \"cramming\" his new playbook, has been almost defiant in response to suggestions his body is too worn down for him to be effective anymore. When he arrived last week he said those who questioned him \"don't know football.\" He was a little tamer Sunday but described \"sitting on the couch at the house,\" listening to people on television \"giving their opinion.\"I love to watch TV, what about you?", "summary": "Yes, sometimes.

Former Broad Run High quarterback Connor Jessop joined the team Sunday and appeared at practice wearing No. 2. Jessop, a Division II all-American at Shepherd University, went undrafted last spring but participated in the Redskins' rookie minicamp. He was not signed after the minicamp. To make room for Jessop, Washington waived wide receiver Allenzae Staggers, who had been signed by the team last week. The Redskins also waived defensive back Darius Hillary, a veteran of the Cleveland Browns' and Oakland' Raiders' practice squads who had been signed last week. They added former Arizona State defensive tackle JoJo Wicker, considered a sleeper before the draft, who went unpicked. He was cut by Detroit last week.

No fight might be more contested than the one for the final two or three wide receiver spots, a tussle that is complicated by the fact that two of the most interesting prospects - former Ram Brian Quick and Cam Sims, an undrafted rookie from Alabama - have missed several days with leg injuries. Neither has practiced since the second preseason game against the New York Jets. \"Quick started off really strong in camp and then had that thigh, and Cam, too, had his big game and then he hurt his thigh,\" Gruden said. \"Unfortunately they are unavailable to participate, so it makes it very tough, especially like a young guy like Cam who was coming and you see the progress but then it gets stopped and we got to hope he gets ready soon. \"I like them both,\" Gruden added. \"There's a lot to like about both those guys, and we might possibly keep them both, so we will wait and see.

The days after games have never been great for the Washington Redskins' new running back, especially for a player who has made a career thundering through lines, all but looking for contact. But after playing his first game in nine months Friday night, Peterson said he was surprised that his body didn't throb more. Other than some soreness in his neck, he actually felt good. \"I could have had another 15 carries,\" he said. The 11 rushes he had for 56 yards in Friday's loss to the Denver Broncos have become the story of the preseason for Washington. Few could have expected the 33-year-old, onetime MVP, who went unsigned through the summer, to look like the player he was in his prime. Not with the injuries that damaged his past two seasons.

And for nearly as long, the players have disagreed, saying the addition of two regular season games to the schedule would add to an already taxing toll on their bodies. \"The regular season should not be extended,\" Troy Aikman, the quarterback who helped lead Jones's Cowboys to all those Super Bowls in the 1990s, told the Daily Oklahoman in 1997. \"Sixteen games are about all anyone's body can handle.\" [NFL teams are increasingly trying to avoid the preseason fate of Marqise Lee and the Jaguars] The players have only become more entrenched in their stance in light of recent research into the sport's negative effects on brain health, but that hasn't stopped Jones from trying to lengthen the regular season.

Ebersol, the son of XFL executive Dick Ebersol, will lead the latest attempt at professional spring football with the American Alliance of Football, an eight-team start-up set to kick off in 2019. \"This is a massive gap in the market,\" Ebersol said during the Alliance's rollout on Tuesday. \"This is a marketplace of tens of millions of Americans who have been telling us for decades that they want to see high quality football longer than the football season.\" But the AAF's launch comes with the game in the midst of an existential crisis, according to some experts, or in the belly of a severe market correction, according to others. Both groups agree the news surrounding football certainly isn't good.

College football is a multibillion-dollar business. The Arena Football League still exists, although it's set to play this season with just four teams. High school football owns Friday nights in a large portion of the South and Midwest, and McMahon, the WWE and XFL founder, is reviving his league in 2020. \"I live in Big Ten country,\" said Scott Tainsky, who studies sports economics at Wayne State University. \"On any given Saturday, you're looking at hundreds of thousands of fans who are going to games and tens of millions more watching on TV.\" So is there really a market for more football?

Eight years later, Johnson, a cornerback out of Southern University, is one of two undrafted rookies to make the Washington Redskins' 53-man roster. \"It still is surreal to me,\" Johnson said. \"I can't even explain how it feels. I don't have the words to explain how I feel, just being a small kid from Jackson, Louisiana, and I'm just blessed to be here. \"It means a lot, especially after not hearing my name called during the draft.\" The tears were flowing back in Louisiana on Saturday as cuts were being made around the NFL before a 4 p.m. roster deadline. Johnson and wide receiver Cam Sims were the only undrafted rookies to stick with the Redskins. Johnson has a group text with a number of family members, and he broke the news there instead of making individual calls. \"I screamed, I cried,\" Danny's mother, Lisa Ferguson, said. \"It was just a happy moment. That's like a dream there.\" [Kapri Bibbs among eight players signed to Redskins practice squad] Johnson's success isn't a complete surprise to the family considering they have grown accustomed to his persistent hard work and determination, but they never envisioned an NFL career.

The team would have the option, though, of applying a transition tag, which would mean paying him 120 percent of his previous salary.Because Bell has not been paid anything this season, that salary figure could come from the 2017 season, when he made $12.1 million, so the transition tag would garner him around $14.5 million next year.

{"text": "If we don't show recruits that we've committed and invested in our football program, then the messaging is that, and so we've got some work to do in that area.\" Also unpalatable for recruits is the abundance of elbow room during games at Scott Stadium, where attendance has been sagging for years. Scott Stadium holds 61,500, but the Cavaliers have announced a home crowd of more than 40,000 only three times during Mendenhall's two seasons: 49,270 for his first game at the school; 48,609 for last season's regular season finale against Virginia Tech; and 40,882 for a Week 7 matchup against North Carolina in 2016. Virginia won six games this past season and went to a bowl game for the first time since 2011. But seasons such as those have become the exception over the last decade, during which time Virginia has endured six years with four wins or fewer. The Cavaliers have had one winning season since 2008 and twice have finished with two victories, including going 2-10 in 2017, a jarring reality check for Mendenhall after he spoke about directing Virginia to a bowl game in his first year in Charlottesville. Among her first goals after meeting with Mendenhall, Williams said, was to raise an additional $500,000 per year for the football budget over the next five years. Following meetings with donors, the figure quickly grew to $1 million because of their belief in Mendenhall's vision to rebuild the program.

In June 2017, the Virginia Board of Visitors authorized fundraising and planning for a football operations center at an estimated cost of $55 to $60 million. The building would house all the necessities and amenities to attract top recruits, an area in which the Cavaliers have been lagging behind their ACC counterparts, most notably in-state rival Virginia Tech. The football staff operates largely out of the McCue Center, located across the street from John Paul Jones Arena, the Cavaliers' state-of-the-art home court for men's and women's basketball. But McCue, which opened in 1991, has grown outdated compared to those at the likes of Clemson, Florida State, Virginia Tech, Miami and other conference powers. \"If there is a four- or five-star recruit from the Tidewater area or Norfolk, let's just say, and they've narrowed their choices to Virginia, to Notre Dame, to Stanford, to Michigan and they take visits to those places, they're going to choose the schools that they think are making an investment in their future,\" Williams said. \"Because if you're a four-star recruit, you probably have aspirations of playing the NFL, and your college experience is your opportunity to do that.

That, plus the lucrative opportunity to coach a team in the nation's capital at 86,000-plus-seat FedEx Field made the decision to take the Redskins' job easy. \"It was the opportunity to coach on the national scene for a team that plays in the largest stadium in the National Football League, that sells all those tickets and with all those fans,\" Spurrier said yesterday by telephone from his home in Gainesville, Fla. \"They're the best fans in the NFL.

{"text": "Le&rsquo;Veon Bell is reportedly back in Pittsburgh. But the disgruntled running back would still apparently rather post tweets than report to the Steelers.A terse Twitter post by Bell on Monday, in which he bade farewell to Miami, where he had been training while holding out from his NFL team, gave many the impression that his next stop would be Pittsburgh. That appears to have been the case, but so far, he has been more interested in playing basketball than the sport he could have been making millions by playing this season.He also was interested on Wednesday in making something of a defense of his lengthy absence from the Steelers, who placed a $14.55 million franchise tag on Bell this summer after failing to come to an agreement on a long-term contract. With an eye toward getting a lucrative deal from another team in free agency next spring &mdash; as long as he stays healthy &mdash; the three-time Pro Bowler has declined thus far to sign the one-year offer, in the process costing himself over $855,000 each week since the regular season began.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not apologizing for what I believe is right for myself, family and the rest of my peers, period,&rdquo; Bell said in a Twitter post rendered in upside-down text. Le'Veon Bell back in Pittsburgh but still tweeting rather than reporting to Steelers &ldquo;Also if you&rsquo;re really finding the time to figure out what I&rsquo;m saying, you&rsquo;ve proved my point.&rdquo;According to ESPN&rsquo;s Jeremy Fowler, who noted that there was &ldquo;no indication Wednesday that Bell had visited the team&rsquo;s facility,&rdquo; a manager of a Pittsburgh gym confirmed that Bell was shooting hoops there on Tuesday. He has until this coming Tuesday, Nov. 13, to sign with the Steelers if he wants to play football at all this season, but there could be significant financial incentives for him not to do so.As Fowler pointed out, the Steelers would be very unlikely to place a third straight franchise tag on Bell after this season, because that would obligate them to pay him more than $20 million, an exorbitant sum for a non-quarterback, for the 2019 campaign. The team would have the option, though, of applying a transition tag, which would mean paying him 120 percent of his previous salary.Because Bell has not been paid anything this season, that salary figure could come from the 2017 season, when he made $12.1 million, so the transition tag would garner him around $14.5 million next year. However if he signs before Tuesday and ends up playing in, say, six games at full pay, that would mean he earned $5.13 million this year, and 120 percent of that would be roughly $6.2 million.If that&rsquo;s how it plays out, Bell and the players' union would almost certainly contest any attempt by the Steelers to set such a relatively low 2019 salary figure for him, but he might decide to simply avoid that scenario by sitting out the rest of the season. Doing so, though, would cost him a year of NFL service, which would have implications for his pension, health care benefits, 401(k) plan and other financial calculations.There has been speculation that Bell and the Steelers may have already come to an informal understanding, one in which they agree to simply let him walk in free agency without placing any tag on him, if he stays away from the team for the rest of the season. It&rsquo;s possible, if the Steelers have yet to clearly signal that they are willing to go along with this arrangement, that his arrival in Pittsburgh is meant to prod them into doing so.The Steelers would have reason to possibly prefer that Bell stays away, given that the team has attained a solid 5-2-1 record in his absence, with backup running back James Conner making his own Pro Bowl bid.

He has until this coming Tuesday, Nov. 13, to sign with the Steelers if he wants to play football at all this season, but there could be significant financial incentives for him not to do so.As Fowler pointed out, the Steelers would be very unlikely to place a third straight franchise tag on Bell after this season, because that would obligate them to pay him more than $20 million, an exorbitant sum for a non-quarterback, for the 2019 campaign. The team would have the option, though, of applying a transition tag, which would mean paying him 120 percent of his previous salary.Because Bell has not been paid anything this season, that salary figure could come from the 2017 season, when he made $12.1 million, so the transition tag would garner him around $14.5 million next year.

According to King, Zimmerman and his wife moved in October to an assisted living facility in Indiana, close to her family, where he died Thursday.After graduating from Columbia Journalism School, Zimmerman latched on with the Sacramento Bee and covered a variety of sports there for several years before returning to New York in 1960 (per a memoir republished in 2016). He moved six years later from the World Telegram to the New York Post, where he began an 11-year stint as a Jets beat writer before being hired by SI in 1979.Over three decades at the magazine, Zimmerman was able to draw on his firsthand knowledge of how the modern NFL had evolved while also proving adept at taking advantage of how the Internet provided a new platform for his extended musings. Of his time as Zimmerman&rsquo;s editor at SI&rsquo;s website, Jimmy Traina wrote on Thursday, &ldquo;Not only was I treated to reading and editing his tremendous writing each week, but I was also able to work with a man in his 70s who understood the Internet better than any other writer.&ldquo;He was so ahead of his time with how he wrote for an online audience. His mailbag was unlike any other mailbag there is or ever will be,&rdquo; Traina continued. &ldquo;His columns gave you an inside look at the technical aspect of football &mdash; he loved critiquing line play &mdash; but he wrote in a way the common fan could understand.&rdquo;Through it all, Zimmerman&rsquo;s writing style contributed to a gruff, even cantankerous old-school persona, but that was belied by the affection he inspired among those who knew him.&ldquo;The Zim I was lucky enough to get to know was every bit as extraordinary in real life as the man who covered football like no other, before, during or since,&rdquo; Michael Silver, a former SI colleague now with NFL.com, wrote Thursday. &ldquo;He was gutsy, gritty and bawdy, teeming with over-the-top quirks and propelled by a ruthless work ethic that was counterbalanced by humor and an indefatigable zest for adventure.&rdquo;I think it would have gotten boring after they reached 60 points, then exciting again after 100, when the novelty of it is just \"how high can they go\"  and \"will the other team score at all?\"  I'm much more interested in the strategy behind the game.  Only real players can give you that insight, like Paul Zimmerman, who wrote for Sports Illustrated.", "summary": "Yeah, I know he was highly respected and it was very sad when he passed away."}

{"text": "Tom Benson, shown with wife Gayle, was a familiar figure at Saints games. (Dave Martin/AP) Tom Benson, a towering figure in New Orleans who owned the NFL's Saints and the NBA's Pelicans, died Thursday at the age of 90. His widow, Gayle Benson, assumed control of both teams, although some members of Benson's family may try again to contest that.

{"text": "Steve Smith Sr., shown in 2014, is learning how to deal with depression. (Evan Habeeb/USA Today) Over 16 seasons in the NFL, Steve Smith Sr. developed a reputation for being one of the toughest wide receivers in the game. But he never really appreciated the accolades and stats he piled up, he says now, because he was struggling with depression throughout his playing career. \"Despite all of my achievements, I routinely felt trapped, inferior and alone,\" Smith wrote this week in a first-person column on NFL.com. \"This overwhelmed me internally and often left me mentally, physically and emotionally broken.\" Such struggles among pro athletes have become a regular media topic in recent days; last weekend, for example, former Philadelphia Eagles great Brian Dawkins said in his Hall of Fame induction speech that his deepest days of depression led him to consider methods of suicide that would allow his family to collect on his life insurance. For Smith, the 1,031 career catches for 14,731 yards (eighth all-time) and 81 touchdowns with the Carolina Panthers and Baltimore Ravens didn't really register, he wrote in the column, because of his internal battles. \"I never truly enjoyed those moments,\" he wrote, \"never felt genuine delight in my accomplishments.\" His playing persona seemed invulnerable, impossibly strong and feisty, willing to take on all defenders.

But he never really appreciated the accolades and stats he piled up, he says now, because he was struggling with depression throughout his playing career. \"Despite all of my achievements, I routinely felt trapped, inferior and alone,\" Smith wrote this week in a first-person column on NFL.com. \"This overwhelmed me internally and often left me mentally, physically and emotionally broken.\" Such struggles among pro athletes have become a regular media topic in recent days; last weekend, for example, former Philadelphia Eagles great Brian Dawkins said in his Hall of Fame induction speech that his deepest days of depression led him to consider methods of suicide that would allow his family to collect on his life insurance. For Smith, the 1,031 career catches for 14,731 yards (eighth all-time) and 81 touchdowns with the Carolina Panthers and Baltimore Ravens didn't really register, he wrote in the column, because of his internal battles. \"I never truly enjoyed those moments,\" he wrote, \"never felt genuine delight in my accomplishments.\" His playing persona seemed invulnerable, impossibly strong and feisty, willing to take on all defenders.

Beckham and rookie Saquon Barkley are one of the best wide receiver-running back tandems in the NFL. Barkley is fourth in the league with 481 rushing yards and tied for fifth with five rushing touchdowns. His seven rushes of 20-plus yards are a league high, and his three runs of 40-plus yards are tied for the NFL best.&ldquo;I think the teams that he had those runs against, they had their eye out on him,\" Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said. \"It&rsquo;s just hard.

Redskins' defense is stout, but it has yet to face a duo like Saquon Barkley and Odell Beckham Jr. They just make people miss in the hole. Sometimes free hitters, you have the gaps covered and he cuts it back, and one free player has to make that tackle, but he jump-cuts out of you. He runs you over. He stiff-arms you, and then all hell breaks loose.

But the combination of Barkley and Beckham makes Sunday&rsquo;s matchup a little different.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the defensive coordinator&rsquo;s problem and nightmare,\" Gruden said with a laugh. \"It&rsquo;s good that our front is doing a very good job against the run without having to bring a lot of safeties in a lot of times, but Saquon is a different guy. He&rsquo;s a combination of Kamara, who can catch it out of the backfield, and the quickness of Zeke Elliott, who&rsquo;s got the power and the speed.No, I do not follow the Redskins.

As Washington tight end Vernon Davis, who was Smith's teammate years ago with the 49ers, said Sunday: \"Thirteen years, you see all those things.\" Then Davis went even further than Smith in his observation of this team. \"All the guys in here are great athletes, but this team has everything you are looking for from a group,\" Davis said. \"Nobody in here is about himself. I can't go around this room and say: 'This guy is egotistic.' Alex Smith has seen a lot in the NFL.

But then he paused and said something that hasn't been suggested often about teams here in recent years. \"I think we have a bunch of guys who are all in,\" he said.

{"text": "I think that quickly becomes apparent when you put all those things together. \"You can see what guys are really made of, who's faking it. And I think we have a bunch of guys who are all in.\" Of course, things can change. Washington is already looking at adding established running backs such as Jamaal Charles, who visited Sunday, or Adrian Peterson, who will meet with team officials Monday. A star can make a difference on the field but also can change the chemistry of a locker room for better or for worse. \"You don't know what you are made of [as a team] until you get put into situations where the intensity gets turned up, the pressure gets turned up, you're facing tough times,\" Smith said. \"How are you going to handle it? How are you going to respond when adversity comes?\" For now, though, he looks around a new locker room, filled with new faces, and he gets a feeling he hasn't always had from a team.

You want to come to D.C.? I&rsquo;ll hook you up with tickets and field passes, guy, whoever you are. That was incredible.

Him and Sean Taylor. So for him to mention me on the pod, I was like, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re kidding me, right?&rsquo;&rdquo;Totolo, who asked a Redskins fan sitting in his section to record the contest and ensuing celebration, tweeted the video at Cooley on Wednesday morning.&ldquo;This is all time awesome man,&rdquo; Cooley replied. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Totolo and his dad were already planning to attend the Redskins' game at Jacksonville in December.

{"text": "Ohio State President Michael Drake and Urban Meyer at Wednesday night's news conference. (Paul Vernon/Associated Press) Ohio State's decision to suspend Urban Meyer for three games over his handling of domestic violence allegations about a former assistant disgusted plenty of college football observers. For many, the punishment was deemed insufficient, the coach's subsequent statements misguided and oblivious. The Meyer incident was enough to drive ESPN's Michelle Beadle to publicly swear that she will not watch football this fall, although her network makes a large chunk of its revenue from the college and NFL games and she must discuss both as a co-host of the \"Get Up\" morning show. \"There's a reason why this will be the second season I don't watch NFL and I don't spend my Saturdays watching college football either,\" Beadle said Thursday. \"I believe that the sport of football has set itself up to be in a position where it shows itself in the bigger picture to not really care about women - they don't really care about people of color, but we won't get into that for [the] NFL either. But as a woman, I feel like a person who has been marginalized.\" It's hard to blame her. The NFL mishandled the domestic violence crisis that stemmed from the Ray Rice incident in 2014. It took months for the league to realize how badly it angered women, an audience it was actively courting at the time. And the New York Giants showed that the league's problem with women still existed two years later by mishandling allegations about kicker Josh Brown, giving him an initial punishment that seemed like a slap on the wrist. [How Urban Meyer dodged facing questions about the worst parts of the Ohio State investigation findings] Meyer was suspended by Ohio State on Wednesday after an investigation found that he and Athletic Director Gene Smith failed to inform the school's compliance department about accusations made against former assistant coach Zach Smith in 2015, and instead awaited the conclusion of a law enforcement investigation that ultimately produced no criminal charges.

The Meyer incident was enough to drive ESPN's Michelle Beadle to publicly swear that she will not watch football this fall, although her network makes a large chunk of its revenue from the college and NFL games and she must discuss both as a co-host of the \"Get Up\" morning show. \"There's a reason why this will be the second season I don't watch NFL and I don't spend my Saturdays watching college football either,\" Beadle said Thursday. \"I believe that the sport of football has set itself up to be in a position where it shows itself in the bigger picture to not really care about women - they don't really care about people of color, but we won't get into that for [the] NFL either. But as a woman, I feel like a person who has been marginalized.\" It's hard to blame her. The NFL mishandled the domestic violence crisis that stemmed from the Ray Rice incident in 2014. It took months for the league to realize how badly it angered women, an audience it was actively courting at the time. And the New York Giants showed that the league's problem with women still existed two years later by mishandling allegations about kicker Josh Brown, giving him an initial punishment that seemed like a slap on the wrist.

The investigation determined that when Meyer learned that Zach Smith's ex-wife, Courtney, was publicly accusing him of ignoring her claims of domestic violence, one of the first things the head coach did was discuss with an assistant how to delete old text messages from his phone, so reporters couldn't see them. When the university took the phone, it had been set to save text messages only for the previous year.

He did not apologize to her. \"And every single one of these stories that comes out, every single time, pushes me further and further away\" from football, Beadle said. \"I realize they don't care, but for me it's opened up my weekends.

Gruden acknowledged that at his postgame news conference. \"It's not time for that any more,\" he said. The Raiders lost Jon Gruden\u2019s first game back. And man, could they have used Khalil Mack. \"It's about getting this football team better. And it wasn't good enough tonight.\" The outcome was no surprise. The Rams reached the playoffs last season as their first-year coach, Sean McVay, transformed Jared Goff into a franchise quarterback and helped tailback Todd Gurley to be a league MVP candidate. The Rams upped the stakes this past offseason by adding wide receiver Brandin Cooks, defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh and cornerbacks Marcus Peters and Aqib Talib. They are in Super Bowl-or-bust mode. And after a sluggish start Monday, understandable after McVay kept his offensive stars under wraps during the preseason, the Rams gradually asserted themselves as the game progressed and took complete control late. They outscored the Raiders, 23-0, in the second half. The Raiders led, 13-10, at halftime and were tied at 13 until the final moments of the third quarter. \"The crowd was in it,\" Gruden said afterward of his team's early success. \"It was electrifying. Unfortunately we could not bottle it and sustain it.\" The way in which the Raiders lost was troubling. Carr made puzzling mistakes, throwing one interception on an up-for-grabs pass and another that was returned for a touchdown by Peters. The Raiders sacked Goff only once, on a play during which Bruce Irvin forced a fumble. Other than that, the Oakland defense could put almost no pressure on Goff. The absence of Mack, the former NFL defensive player of the year, was glaring. In the first half Sunday night, Mack had a sack, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery, an interception and a touchdown on defense. He and the Bears could not sustain that, and they succumbed to the second-half exploits of Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. But Mack reinforced what a game-changing, difference-making player he is. He left little doubt that he is worth the six-year, $141 million contract given to him by the Bears, making him the league's highest-paid defensive player. [The NFL teams that have serious reasons to worry, versus the ones that don't] Mack, while still with the Raiders, had been holding out, seeking such a deal. The Raiders didn't want to give it to him. They have a $125 million quarterback in Carr. They have a $100 million coach in Gruden. They drew the line at handing out another mammoth deal, not wanting to further strain their budget or push the boundaries of the salary cap. They regarded the king's ransom of draft picks put forth by the Bears, including a pair of first-rounders, as an offer they couldn't refuse. In truth, they could have refused it. They could have kept Mack and waited until he showed up. Or they could have given him a huge contract. They had an operating profit of $41 million last season, according to Forbes. That's modest by NFL standards, but nevertheless considerable. Their financial situation will improve once they relocate to Las Vegas. The salary cap grows annually, and contracts such as Carr's and Mack's won't seem as daunting in a couple years. The Raiders can try to justify the trade by maintaining that they couldn't afford to pay both Mack and Carr. They can envision using the first-rounders that they'll receive from the Bears to attempt to bolster their roster by the time they move to Vegas. But they'll have to cash in on those draft choices. They'll have to try to find a pass rusher who can change a game like Mack can. In the meantime, Gruden must attempt to win with a roster that is old and lacking. The early returns Monday were not particularly promising. Things might not get better in the foreseeable future. And every time that Mack plays well for the Bears, the Raiders' decision to trade him looks that much worse.I think that Jon Gruden is a sensible loss for the team,", "summary": "What do you mean by sensible loss?

The Rams' offense is explosive. It's their defense that makes them the Super Bowl favorite. There are two main reasons for this: They can consistently push the pocket and cover downfield. The Rams are not an elite run defense, and it&rsquo;s unlikely their sack totals will impress (just four in three games so far) &mdash; but if you fall behind against this team, it is nearly impossible to catch up.The reason for this goes back to how they&rsquo;re built. The Rams possess two top-level pass-rushing defensive tackles, starting with Aaron Donald, who is the NFL&rsquo;s best. L.A. paired him this year with Ndamukong Suh, one of the most dominant interior linemen of the past decade.They also possess a starting back-four in their secondary that&rsquo;s as good as any in the NFL.

Peters and fellow cornerback Aqib Talib suffered injuries in Sunday&rsquo;s win over the Chargers, but both will be back this season and their performance through three games has already solidified this team as the Super Bowl favorite.Teams simply cannot find holes down the field consistently against this group.Ram's become the youngest head coach.", "summary": "Thats really interesting.
